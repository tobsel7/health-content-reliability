<h2>Kenyan Ambassador: Obama&#8217;s Birthplace &#8220;Already Well Known In&nbsp;Kenya&#8221;</h2>
<span class="submitted">November, 21, 2008 &#8212; nicedeb </span>

<div class="content">
<div class='snap_preview'><p>I wasn&#8217;t going to say any more about the Obama birth certificate controversy, but I found this intriguing.</p>
<p><a href="http://my.wrif.com/mim/?p=916">Mike in the Morning,</a> a radio talk show out of Detroit MI, (of all places!), decided to call the Kenyan embassy a little over a week ago, and talk about the reaction in Kenya to Obama&#8217;s victory in the 2008 Presidential election. I think it was meant to be a light hearted interview&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t seem like they went into this with the intention of making headlines. They started off talking to a secretary, but were eventually patched through to the Kenyan Ambassador, H.E. Peter Ogego. The pertinent part of the audio starts at 2:35:</p>
<p><span style='text-align:center; display: block;'><object width='425' height='350'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/SQaYAAJgIvY&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/SQaYAAJgIvY&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='425' height='350' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p>My impression is that the question about Obama&#8217;s birthplace was meant as a joke&#8230; not to be taken seriously. But His Excellency Peter Ogego answered it seriously, and frankly.</p>
<p>A few things to consider in case you&#8217;re thinking this was some sort of prank:</p>
<p>1. The audio of this conversation (the first part of the call can be heard, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDKa4iPdQfQ">here</a>) is posted at the WRIF radio station&#8217;s website.  I doubt the station would put its reputation and FCC radio license on the line for a hoax.</p>
<p>2. That sure sounds like H.E. Peter Ogego&#8217;s voice. Compare <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/02/26/Ambassador_of_Kenya_H_E__Peter_Ogego">here.</a></p>
<p>3. Listen to the genuine surprise of the talk show hosts after the call.</p>
<p>The only argument that detractors can convincingly make, is that the Ambassador and most, if not all of Kenya&#8217;s citizen&#8217;s, including Obama&#8217;s Kenyan grandmother,<a href="http://theswordoftruth.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/audiotape-bombshell-obamas-grandmother-says-he-was-born-in-kenya/"> (who claims to have witnessed his birth)</a>, are mistaken about this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=81547">WND</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At least two of his relatives in Kenya claim to have been present at his birth in Mombasa, Kenya. In addition, the Obama machine has scoffed at requests to see the form of the Hawaiian birth certificate that includes the specific hospital in which the delivery took place. The form released by the campaign does not include that information, leading to suspicions Obama might have been one of the foreign-born babies of the 1960s who were, nonetheless, provided birth certificates by the state of Hawaii.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=80931">And:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hawaii Revised Statute 338-178 allows registration of birth in Hawaii for a child that was born outside of Hawaii to parents who, for a year preceding the child’s birth, claimed Hawaii as their place of residence,&#8221; the document said. &#8220;The only way to know where Senator Obama was actually born is to view Senator Obama&#8217;s original birth certificate from 1961 that shows the name of the hospital and the name and signature of the doctor that delivered him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=81484">The Supremes will also be reviewing</a> one of the citizenship cases on December 5th.</p>
<p>Alan Keyes, who was a candidate for President in the 2008 race, <a href="http://nicedeb.wordpress.com/2008/11/15/alan-keyes-files-ca-court-petition-regarding-obamas-eligibility/">has filed a CA court petition </a>regarding Obama&#8217;s eligibility.</p>
<p>To be honest, until now, I&#8217;ve been pretty convinced that Obama was born in Hawaii, but that there were still some legitimate questions about his citizenship because of the years he was a citizen of Indoniesia. Now I&#8217;m reconsidering my earlier assessment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=81484"></a></p>
<p>I guess this makes me a &#8220;truther&#8221;, or &#8220;fringe&#8221; blogger. But until Obama produces that vault birth certificate, I will question his eligibility. Aren&#8217;t we still a nation of laws?</p>

<p>You would think that the media would be just a teensy bit interested in this.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE III (Nov. 24):</strong></p>
<p>Via <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/">Atlas Shrugs</a>, Alan Keyes&#8217; Lawyer, Orly Taitz, has issued the following statement:</p>
<ol>We need to write to all the governmental official listed in the attachments, including pres Bush, that due to the fact that Mr. Obama refused to provide proof of eligibility (Hawaii allows to issue birth certificates to children of Hawaiian residents, that are born abroad, and issue them based on a statement of one realtive only) , he cannot be certified as President and he cannot receive National Security CIA briefings.</p>
<p><strong>We believe all the Secretaries of State should give Mr. Obama 24 hours to sign the consent for release of any and all documents, verifying his eligibility, including, but not limited to a certified copy of his original birth certificate with the name and the signature of the doctor and the name of the hospital, certified copy of the birthing records from the hospital noted in the birth certificate, any and all passports with all the immigration stamps, application and registration forms from Columbia university, Harvard college, Occidental College and the schools in Indonesia, that Mr. Obama attended; and official response from the Governments of Great Britain, Kenya and Indonesia in regards to Mr. Obama’s citizenship status in those countries. If Mr. Obama refuses to provide such consent, or if the consent is provided, but the documents show him to be ineligible, no Secretary of State and no Governor of State has any legal right to sign the Certificate of Ascertainment, no Elector has any legal right to sign a certificate of vote, since doing so will constitute aiding and abetting fraud in voting and punishable by up to 3 years in jail (California election code 18500) and similarly punishable by corresponding statutes in other states of the union, it possibly can be viewed as aiding and abeting commission of treason.</strong></p>
<p>This has to be forwarded to all the media outlets. We need to write to the media, that American citizens are reasonably relying on them to provide them with information in regards to such issues of National Importance. Refusal by Media to publish information in regards to Mr. Obama’s status as a British Citizen by birth and other issues relating to his lack of eligibility to be the President of the US, is de facto aiding and abetting commission of fraud in voting and elections (see above).</p>
<p>I believe we should contact all sponsors and all advertisers and all citizens that believe in the Constitution of this country an demand that they boycott all the media outlets that refuse to air this information that is akin to a Constitutional crisis. We should start a recall of all the Governors and Secretaries of States that sign the certificates of Ascertainment without proof of eligibility. No member of US military can be expected to risk his life under orders of a Commander in Chief, who was not willing to produce proof of his eligibility for office, no order or law signed by somebody, who was not proven to be eligible will be valid. We have to stop this constitutional crisis.</ol>
<p>Orly Taitz DDS Esq</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (November 28):</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=82060">WND</a> took the initiative to call the Kenyan Ambassador, H.E. Peter Ogego. He claims that his words were &#8220;misquoted and edited&#8221; for the radio program. But they couldn&#8217;t have been edited because the interview ran live, and he wasn&#8217;t misquoted either. He said what he said.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Clark:</strong></em> &#8220;We want to congratulate you on Barack Obama, our new president, and you must be very proud.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Ogego:</strong></em> &#8220;We are. We are. We are also proud of the U.S. for having made history as well.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><em>Fellhauer:</em></strong> &#8220;One more quick question, President-elect Obama&#8217;s birthplace over in Kenya, is that going to be a national spot to go visit, where he was born?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Ogego:</strong></em> &#8220;It&#8217;s already an attraction. His paternal grandmother is still alive.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><em>Fellhauer:</em></strong> &#8220;His birthplace, they&#8217;ll put up a marker there?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><strong>Ogego:</strong></em> &#8220;It would depend on the government. It&#8217;s already well known.&#8221;</p>
<table style="height:22px;" border="0" width="10" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So now Ogego is saying the hosts misquoted and edited the audio recording of his comments.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m already infuriated by the whole thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The radio itself had a cynicism to it. I didn&#8217;t mind that, but to misquote me is unacceptable. They are circulating misinformation regarding Mr. Obama&#8217;s birthplace.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>However, WRIF&#8217;s Mike Clark told WND the show never manipulated the audio recording in anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you that nothing was edited or stated out of context,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ogego insisted he was speaking about Barack Obama Sr., and not President-elect Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;They asked me about Obama&#8217;s father, not Obama,&#8221; Ogego said with a raised voice. &#8220;This is common-sense knowledge. Nobody is fooling anybody.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But Clark said Ogego&#8217;s claim that he was speaking about Barack Obama Sr. doesn&#8217;t add up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you listen to the call in its entirety, you will find it was very obvious we were all talking about President-elect Barack Obama and not his father,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;So, the idea that he thought we were talking about his father seems a little farfetched to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark said Ogego&#8217;s statement that Obama&#8217;s Kenyan birthplace was already an attraction caught them off guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is, we expected him to say, &#8216;No. Obama was not born in Kenya, but there is an attraction to honor his father.&#8217; I would have thought that would have been the answer if anything,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Curiouser and curiouser.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(December 21):</p>
<p><a href="http://nicedeb.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/kenyan-government-imposes-gag-order-on-obamas-extended-family/">Kenyan Government Issues Gag Order On Obama&#8217;s Kenyan Family</a><strong><a href="http://nicedeb.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/kenyan-government-imposes-gag-order-on-obamas-extended-family/">.</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The government has blocked Kenyan members of President-elect Barrack Obama’s extended family from talking to the media. Family members will have to ask permission from government before issuing making any statement concerning Obama. The government will also vet all those seeking information about the family.</p>
<p>“We are doing this because we want to ensure better flow of information.</p></blockquote>

	<p>Re: “Hawaii Revised Statute 338-178 allows registration of birth in Hawaii for a child that was born outside of Hawaii to parents who, for a year preceding the child’s birth, claimed Hawaii as their place of residence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you could register a child born outside of Hawaii in Hawaii. BUT you could not register a child born outside of Hawaii in Hawaii with a registration that she or he was born in Hawaii. In other words, you could get a document saying that this child was born, is the child of so and so, but the document does not and legally cannot say that the child was born at Place A if she or he was born at Place B.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s COLB says that he was born in Hawaii. The officials in Hawaii have said that they looked into the file and found evidence that confirmed the COLB is accurate &#8211; and that includes the place of birth.</p>

	<p>Re: I’ve never been able to get past the fact that he refuses to release it. I simply cannot think of a reason why he would, unless he has something to hide.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The certification of live birth is adequate to prove that you were born in the USA. It is the document you use to get a driver’s license. It is used to get a passport. </p>
<p>In Obama’s case it says all over it (three times) that he was born in Hawaii. It is the only document that the state of Hawaii issues when you ask for a birth certificate, and the officials in Hawaii have stated that they looked into their files and found in them evidence that confirms the certification of live birth is authentic.</p>
<p>(2) He thinks that the certification of live birth is sufficient proof, even if it isn’t. (And it is.)</p>
<p>(3) He thinks that the people who believe that he was born outside the USA are somewhat like the people who continue to believe that the US government has stored the bodies of aliens in Rosewell NM. </p>
<p>“You mean they think that my mother traveled to Kenya when she was nine-months pregnant?  In 1961 when there were no direct flights from Hawaii to Africa? When you had to get a Yellow Fever shot to go to Africa? And they believe that my family and I lied and covered up that trip all my life? No! Really? Incredible.”</p>
<p>(4) If you mean by “produce,” that he should publish the portion of the birth certificate you refer to on the Web, there are plenty of problems with that. No one could see the document as clearly as a physical piece of paper, so it is inevitable that someone will claim that it is forged. </p>
<p>(5) IF a court asks to see the document, that’s the right time and right place to show the document. The courts have the capabilities of authenticating documents.</p>
<p>(6) I’m busy picking the next Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>(7) It gives honor to right-wing bloggers, who are the only ones who are demanding that the documents be published. (The law cases ask that the documents be delivered to a court.)</p>
<p>(8) The law cases demanding the documents all say that the plaintiffs have the RIGHT to see my private documents. I might show my documents if I was asked for them nicely, but I’ll be damned if I allow someone to prove that they have the right to see my private documents.</p>
<p>(9) I’ve been busy picking cabinet members and I had never even HEARD that there are some right-wing bloggers who would like to see my birth certificate. Why didn’t they send me a letter?</p>
<p>(10) Do they really really think that my birth certificate will show something different than the certification of live birth? Yes, it will show the hospital and maybe the doctor, but both of those will prove that I was born in Hawaii. Do they really think that the birth certificate will show I was born in Kenya? I mean, what would a Kenya birth certificate be doing in Hawaii files?</p>
<p>(11) Why me? No one has ever asked a president or a presidential candidate to prove his place of birth before. I mean, did they ask Taft for his birth certificate? FDR? JFK? The Bushes? Clinton? Reagan? And, I have shown my certificate. You mean they want more than that?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m a United States citizen. My son was born in Japan. That doesn&#8217;t make him Japanese. It makes him an American born on foreign soil. If Obama&#8217;s mother is an American then Obama gets to be an American too. There is a chance he could choose to have dual citizenship since his father was not an American.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not enough to be a Citizen. According to the Constitution you must be a natural born citizen in order to serve as President of the United States. That means, except in very specific cases, that you must be born on American soil. Obama&#8217;s own grandmother insists she personally, with her own eyes, saw him delivered and held baby Barack in her arms. </p>
<p>So the question is&#8230;.. Would somebody really try and falsify where their child was born? What possible reason would somebody have to want the record to show their son was born in the US instead of in Kenya?? Are you thinking about that?? EXACTLY!</p>
<p>The guy was born in Kenya and eventually he will have to be removed as President by the courts. The sooner the better.</p>

	<p>tkevin:  it was enough to recognize MY U.S. citizenship when I was born in Germany.  Since my father was stationed there at the time while serving in the U.S. Army, I think there were laws in place similiar to what protected McCain&#8217;s status.  Yeah the Obama campaign&#8217;s refusal to release everything is suspicious but frankly this whole thing smells of a desperate fishing expedition that&#8217;s going to make conservatives look really, really bad.  Obama won.  Get over it and work towards a better future.</p>

	<p>Congratulations John. Only a true believer would acknowledge that their refusal to provide proof is suspicious, then in the same paragraph, poo-poo the Constitution. Enforcing the constitutional requirements for the job does not make Conservatives look bad at all. But, trying to circumvent them and get a foreign national elected most certainly makes leftists look as bad as they possibly can. </p>
<p>Get over it? Not a chance. You get the same that you dished out for 8 years.</p>

	<p>John&#8217;s a conservative, Nick. </p>
<p>Look, it&#8217;s a touchy subject because it seems too big, too sensational to be true. </p>
<p>And there IS a whiff of truth to the charge that it smacks of desperation. I, personally would desperately love this closet commie to be disqualified. </p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not making this shit up. He refuses to release his birth certificate to prove that he&#8217;s a natural born citizen. And he&#8217;s hired three lawyers to help him keep that birth certificate under wraps. </p>
<p>The MSM is not touching this story, so anyone who does , seems &#8220;fringe&#8221; or &#8220;tinfoil hat&#8221;. </p>
<p>This may come to a head on Dec. 1st if Obama defies that Souter request to respond to Berg&#8217;s Writ of Certiorari.</p>

	<p>I hadn&#8217;t considered the fact that he was never even baptized, probably the first American President not to have been.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t want MSM coverage of any more BS. I don&#8217;t want riots in the streets. I don&#8217;t want the SCOTUS to waste their valuable time. I just want to know the truth. NOW, not in 50+ years like who actually murdered JFK. I showed my birth certificate to get a passport, enlist in the Navy and serve a year of combat time in Vietnam. Why not the leader of the &#8220;free&#8221; world. Cough it up Barry.</p>

	<p>A couple of things:</p>
<p>An American born on foreign soil is issued a certificate of live birth, usually from the state that the parents are from or claim as residence (or from the embassy if there is one, as in my case, where it was issued from the US embassy in Bangkok, Thailand).  This makes them a US citizen but not eligible to become President, per the Constitution.  However, US military bases are the exception and are considered sovereign US soil, so this makes it a part of the US.</p>
<p>Secondly, the suit was brought by Phil Berg PRIOR to the Nov. 4th elections and was denied standing.  This was an issue that was raised before Obama won the popular election.  </p>
<p>Also, another thing to consider is that, technically, he has not been elected President yet.  This will occur in the electoral college on Dec. 16th.</p>

	<p>the suit was brought by Phil Berg PRIOR to the Nov. 4th elections and was denied standing.</p>
<p>True,  his petition for an injunction to stay the November 4th election was denied, but the Clerk also required the defendants to respond to the Writ of Certiorari (which requires the concurrence of four Justices) by December 1. At that time, Mr. Obama must present to the Court an authentic birth certificate, after which Mr. Berg will respond.</p>

<p>                This is the Truth-The Bankers created the S&amp;L crisis and eliminated the competition and They created the Sub-prime crisis (The Banks create the product not the Loan-Brokers) and will eliminate the Loan Brokers.And have already procured the Treasury-and Federal Reserves&#8217; approval and the Supreme court confirmation to go into Real Estate and as   The now deceased &#8220;George Thatcher&#8221; ( Thatcher who started Sterling S&amp;L and build it into Union bank and sold it to Barclays -Who sold it to a Japanese Financial concern)  told me &#8211;   The Bankers tried this in the depression. As the   &#8220;Movie&#8221;   &#8221; A  Wonderful Life&#8221;  with Jimmy Stewart depicts&#8221;    only this time the &#8220;Jimmy Stewarts of America&#8221;  lose. Due to a ignorant Senate / Congress /and  Public all to willing to buy the (BS) -That the Loan Brokers did it. And this way (With only the Banks left) the Public will save money with No competition (Wrong).   Further  the    Late Senator   &#8220;Henry Hyde&#8221;  of Utah   and   &#8220;Henry Gonzales&#8221;   of Texas held the Bankers at bay till &#8220;Henry Hyde&#8217;s&#8221; apprentice turned on him after he died and &#8220;Sold&#8221; out to the Bankers. </p>
<p>               Lets start a petition and have everyone from the Homeowners&#8217; losing their Homes to the Loan Brokers to the Real Estate community sign under this and get  millions of signatures and STOP the Bankers before it is to late to save the   &#8220;America&#8221;  created by our Founders  OR will we  become like the   &#8220;Serfs of Europe&#8221;    in the 1300-1600s controlled by the Central Bankers as Slaves.</p>
<p>              The plan is for a ALL  powerful Federal-Central government to eliminate the States, And then , Run  &#8220;America&#8221;   Thru the Federal Reserve and its main Bankers  .Example:     B of A will control 22% of ALL Home Loans on the buy out of Countrywide.   This means B of A will control  more than 1 out of 5 Home<br />
              Loans.   Remember the  &#8220;Magna Carta&#8221;  &amp;  the  &#8220;Bill of Rights   &amp;   The Sons of Liberty  &amp;   Thomas Paine&#8217;s  &#8220;Common Sense&#8221;   &amp;  the  Laws against     Monopolies.</p>

Compare   the Loan-Brokers commissions with the Bankers.&#8221; The BANKERS HAD THEIR   HIGHEST PROFIT in HISTORY&#8221;    from 1999-2006 who. and now are     crying   &#8220;Wolf&#8221; .</p>
<p>               Our founders  refused to have a Central Bank&#8211;  until the Traitor-  Wilson   &#8220;SOLD&#8221; out with  J.P. Morgan&#8217;s&#8221;  </p>
<p>                                                          Help  creating the  &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;</p>
<p>              We had absolutely no national debt, had the largest middle class in the world, and Mom stayed home to raise the kids. </p>
<p>              Read what  Pres.  Andrew Jackson  Pres. Thomas Jefferson and Pres. George Washington thought of the Central Bankers.      </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Treasury Department&#8217;s plan to revamp regulation of the nation&#8217;s banks, thrifts and investment banking firms is (so we hear) going nowhere fast. The blueprint &#8211; among other things &#8211; would eliminate state banking charters. As we all know, state chartered banks are at the center of the nation&#8217;s mortgage crisis because they&#8217;re the ones who created all those risky loan programs, securitized subprime mortgages, and sold them overseas in the form of CDOs to foreign investors. Ooops, I&#8217;m sorry that&#8217;s Wall Street where Treasury secretary Henry Paulson used to work. If I were the head of a community bank trade organization I would attack the monster that created the mess: Wall Street. How best to do that? Answer: resurrect Glass-Steagall which (until it was torn down by Congress last decade) prohibited investment bankers from owning depositories and banks from underwriting securities..</p>

<p>No one is charged with the duty of confirming a candidate&#8217;s eligibility.  Only the political party that runs the candidate.  That&#8217;s like relying on a meat packing company&#8217;s word that all its employees are here legally.</p>

	<p>It seems that everything about Obama is misleading</p>
<p>First of all Obama is not BLACK &#8211; he is BIRACIAL</p>
<p>He did use public fianancing when he said he wouldn&#8217;t</p>
<p>He did not willingly give proof of his birthplace &#8211; WHY??</p>
<p>He won&#8217;t send his children to public schools &#8211; WHY??</p>
<p>DEMOCRAT????? &#8211; I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>He says that he is raising taxes on the rich &#8211; Do you really think that OPRAH is going to be affected?? LOL</p>

	<p>Re: &#8220;I simply cannot think of a reason why he would, unless he has something to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The certification of live birth is adequate to prove that you were born in the USA. It is the document you use to get a driver’s license. It is used to get a passport.</p>
<p>In Obama’s case it says all over it (three times) that he was born in Hawaii. It is the only document that the state of Hawaii issues when you ask for a birth certificate, and the officials in Hawaii have stated that they looked into their files and found in them evidence that confirms the certification of live birth is authentic.</p>
<p>(2) He thinks that the certification of live birth is sufficient proof, even if it isn’t. (And it is.)</p>
<p>(3) He thinks that the people who believe that he was born outside the USA are somewhat like the people who continue to believe that the US government has stored the bodies of aliens in Rosewell NM.</p>
<p>“You mean they think that my mother traveled to Kenya when she was nine-months pregnant? You mean they think she traveled to Kenya in 1961 when there were no direct flights from Hawaii to Africa? You mean they think she traveled to Kenya in the ninth month of pregnancy when you had to get a Yellow Fever shot to go to Africa? </p>
<p>And you mean they believe that my family and I lied and covered up that trip all my life? No! Really? Incredible.”</p>
<p>(4) If you mean by “produce,” that he should publish the portion of the birth certificate you refer to on the Web, there are plenty of problems with that. No one could see the document as clearly as a physical piece of paper, so it is inevitable that someone will claim that it is forged.</p>
<p>(5) IF a court asks to see the document, that’s the right time and right place to show the document. The courts have the capabilities of authenticating documents.</p>
<p>(6) I’m busy picking the next Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>(7) It gives honor to right-wing bloggers, who are the only ones who are demanding that the documents be published. (The law cases ask that the documents be delivered to a court.)</p>
<p>(8) The law cases demanding the documents all assert that the plaintiffs have the RIGHT to see my private documents. I might show my documents if I was asked for them nicely, but I’ll be damned if I allow someone to prove that they have the right to see my private documents.</p>
<p>(9) I’ve been busy picking cabinet members and I had never even HEARD that there are some right-wing bloggers who would like to see my birth certificate. Why didn’t they send me a letter?</p>
<p>(10) Do they really really think that my birth certificate will show something different than the certification of live birth? Yes, it will show the hospital and maybe the doctor, but both of those will prove that I was born in Hawaii. Do they really think that the birth certificate will show I was born in Kenya? I mean, what would a Kenya birth certificate be doing in Hawaii files?</p>
<p>(11) Why me? No one has ever asked a president or a presidential candidate to prove his place of birth before. I mean, did they ask Taft for his birth certificate? FDR? JFK? The Bushes? Clinton? Reagan? And, I have shown my certification of live birth. You mean they want more than that?</p>
<p>Re: The only “proof” ever given by Obama is a fraudlent, forged document. See for yourself.</p>
<p>It is an authentic document. The officials in Hawaii have looked into the files and confirmed its accuracy. </p>
<p>The following is from a right-wing blog in Hawaii:</p>
<p>A posting from Andrew Walden, publisher of the Hawaii Free Press, a right-wing blog based in Hawaii.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/main/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/92/Barack-Obama-Born-in-Hawaii.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/main/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/92/Barack-Obama-Born-in-Hawaii.aspx</a></p>
<p>Barack Obama: Born in Hawai`i<br />
by Andrew Walden<br />
|<br />
It is time to focus on REAL issues, not imaginary ones.</p>
<p>A fairly impressive internet industry has sprung up claiming that Obama was born in either Kenya or Indonesia. This is nonsense, which distracts from the broadly unexplored story of Obama&#8217;s upbringing. This kind of nonsense has emerged because the McCain campaign chose not to raise the many questions about Barack Obama&#8217;s numerous hard-left alliances. Barack Obama was born in Hawai`i, August 4, 1961 at Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s birth certificate posted online is exactly the same birth certificate everybody in Hawai`i gets from the State Department of Health. It is not forged. There is nothing unusual about the design or the texture. In addition to the birth certificate, the August 13, 1961 Honolulu Advertiser also carries an announcement of Obama&#8217;s birth. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin also carries the same announcement. Both papers require submission of a copy of the birth certificate to print a birth announcement.</p>

<p>Finally, regarding the Ambassador &#8220;confirming&#8221; that Obama was born in Kenya. I listened to the recording, it is not clear that he understood what he was asked. He could be referring to the Obama family&#8217;s ancestral home. </p>
<p>IF Obama had been born in Kenya, there would be proof of it in Kenya. IF Obama&#8217;s mother had traveled to Kenya, there would be records of her arrival in Kenya in the government files. To believe that the government of Kenya has blocked access to these files means that you think that both the government of Kenya and the government of Hawaii are part of the same giant conspiracy.</p>
<p>And another part of the same conspiracy accounts for the absence of photographs. After all, if you travel to Kenya to see your in-laws, it is normal to have photographs with your in-laws, and it is normal for the in-laws to have photos as well. </p>
<p>And, if you give birth in a hospital in Kenya, it is the kind of event that a woman would tell her friends about sometime in her life, and they would remember it. So, if she had given birth in Kenya, she would have had to keep that fact secret all her life. Why would she do that? Because she thought her son would be elected president?</p>
<p>No. She never traveled to Kenya. She gave birth in Hawaii. The COLB and the officials in Hawaii are right. The misleading tapes from the grandmother and the ambassador are wrong.</p>

	<p>As with several folks who&#8217;ve already posted here, Obama could have silenced the natural born citizenship issue by producing a valid birth certificate that is verifiable. Iraqi Freedom Vet posted a list of obfuscations that Obama and his people have dodged his citizenship issue. For a dude that was a Constitutional Law professor  at  UChicago, he&#8217;s got to know the residency requirements for President of the US, come clean Barry!</p>

	<p>&#8220;An American born on foreign soil is issued a certificate of live birth, usually from the state that the parents are from or claim as residence (or from the embassy if there is one, as in my case, where it was issued from the US embassy in Bangkok, Thailand). This makes them a US citizen but not eligible to become President, per the Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s incorrect.  I was born in a civilian (West) German hospital to American parents, one of whom was active-duty military stationed there.  I have no desire whatsoever to run for president, but I&#8217;m not ineligible to nor does the Constitution say that I am.  Art 1 Sect 8 gives Congress the power &#8220;to establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization&#8221; and according to the Naturalization Act of 1790 I&#8217;m as &#8220;natural born&#8221; as someone from Iowa or whatever state you choose.  If Obama&#8217;s birth meets the same covered by this Act, like it or not he is eligible.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, US military bases are the exception and are considered sovereign US soil, so this makes it a part of the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are children of foreign workers born at these bases American citizens?  Not to the best of my knowledge.  I don&#8217;t believe this is correct that they are sovereign US territory.</p>

	<p>I just have one question for all of you great Constitutional scholars. Where were you eight years ago?</p>
<p>Surely you all recall that Dick Cheney&#8217;s election to the Vice Presidency was in blatant violation of the Constitution. Refer again to Article 2, Section 1 and also the 12th Amendment, &#8220;The electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely you still recall that both George Bush and Dick Cheney were both Texas residents and needed every one of the votes of the Texas electors to prevail in that close election.</p>
<p>Surely none of you were fooled by Cheney&#8217;s fraudulent charade of pretending to become a Wyoming resident AFTER he was nominated for Vice President. We all caught the fact that he never bothered to live in Wyoming or get a Wyoming driver&#8217;s license or change his voter registration to Wyoming or in any other way become a legal resident of Wyoming.</p>
<p>Surely all of you were just as upset and active during the Cheney Constitutional crisis as you are now. Except that somehow I just don&#8217;t remember hearing from any of you back then.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason more people aren&#8217;t rising up to defend the Constitution today is because Bush/Cheney have already run it through the shredder.</p>

	<p>Cheney was a US Rep from Wyoming for many years before he moved to Texas. If he changed his residency to meet the requirements for the Vice Presidency, that would be a calculated, but not unprecedented move. Just ask Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>There was no Cheney Constitutional crisis. </p>
<p>If you honestly believe Bush/Cheney ran the Constitution through the shredder&#8230;wait til Obamba (the guy who tells us it&#8217;s &#8220;fatally flawed&#8221;) gets through with it.</p>

	<p>Re: I showed my birth certificate to get a passport, enlist in the Navy and serve a year of combat time in Vietnam. Why not the leader of the “free” world. Cough it up Barry.</p>
<p>Yes you showed your birth certificate, meaning an official document from the state that confirmed your birth in the state. You did not show, and the Army would not accept a hospital record. These are not considered official documents. Why not? Because they are not standard, and they are not validated by official government agencies. </p>
<p>The certification of live birth IS the official record issued by the state of Hawaii. In the case of Obama, this certification was issued in 2007 or 2008. It is not the original document, but we do not even know that the original document continues to exist in paper form. Maybe it was microfilmed or digitized. It doesn&#8217;t matter. The document issued by the state of Hawaii in 2007 or 2008 is a legal document. The state department would accept it immediately for issuing a passport. The Army would accept it, the Navy and the Marines.</p>
<p>And it says on it three times that Obama was born in Hawaii. There are some blogs that claim (with intent to deceive) that Hawaii has a law that enables parents to register the birth of children born outside of Hawaii and to receive a Hawaii certification of live birth. Yes this is  true. But it was not true in 1961, and it was NEVER true &#8211; then or now &#8212; that Hawaii issued a certification of live birth that said &#8220;born in Hawaii&#8221; to someone who was not born in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s certification says on it  that he was born in Honolulu three times, under location of birth, island of birth (Oahu) and county of birth. And  the officials in Hawaii said that they looked into the file and found that there was evidence confirming the accuracy of the certification, meaning the accuracy of the location of birth (What else?).</p>

	<p>I have a feeling that if Obama were white there would not be this stupid inquiry into his citizenship.</p>
<p>I think this is fringe material from the far right-wing of USA.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should not matter where one is born, as long as one is competent and intelligent. That is what my father says, and it is how I was raised.</p>

	<p><i>I have a feeling that if Obama were white there would not be this stupid inquiry into his citizenship.</i></p>
<p>Nyoop. If Obama were conservative there would not be this stupid inquiry into his citizenship. At least from the Right.</p>
<p><i>Furthermore, it should not matter where one is born, as long as one is competent and intelligent.</i></p>
<p>Why not? It turns out that being competent and intelligent isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; the President needs to understand America and put her before all else.</p>
<p><i>That is what my father says, and it is how I was raised.</i></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no point in complaining about it now.</p>

	<p>Well, the fact of the matter is&#8230;it&#8217;s not up to you. There are constitutional requirements in place for the POTUS, the leader of the free world.</p>
<p>Obama has hired 3 law firms to fight every lawsuit that comes up to impel him to reveal his birth certificate that&#8217;s been sealed in Hawaii. </p>
<p>If he has willfully misrepresented himself to the American people&#8230;shouldn&#8217;t that give one pause that he is actually &#8220;the best person for the job&#8221;?</p>

	<p>Essentially all of SMRStrauss&#8217;s prodigious apologia&#8217;s can be discounted because of one simple fact that DESTROYS his thesis that Hawaii&#8217;s COLB wouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;Born in Hawaii&#8221; if it weren&#8217;t so.</p>
<p>In FACT, Obama&#8217;s SISTER has a COLB that says born in Hawaii as well&#8230;and she is INDISPUTEDLY Born in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Case Closed.  </p>
<p>SMRStrauss, you appear to have spread disinformation regarding what those Hawaiian COLBs really represent.  A truly serious hole in the  system.  This needs to be addressed by the Supreme Court. Let&#8217;s pray the have the guts to take it on forthrightly&#8230;and go to the truth&#8230;no matter what it takes.</p>

	<p>nicedeb,</p>
<p>I just have the feeling that if Obama were white, this would not be an issue. There are a lot of racists behind this citizenship inquiry. The fact that a lot of Republicans are racist is sad, but true, at least in my part of the country.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s an issue because his mother was a world traveler, and married a men from Kenya, and Indonesia. He lived in Indonesia from grades one-six, and was adopted by his father there, becoming an Indonesian citizen. There are valid issues here thwqt have nothing to do with his race. My problem with Obama has to with his Marxist beliefs, and willingness to lie and cheat to get what he wants.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t trust him. </p>
<p>To characterize Republicans as racists because they &#8220;won&#8217;t vote for that (half) black guy&#8221; is wrong headed. Ever heard of Bobby Jindal? Michael Steele? Condoleezza Rice?</p>

	<p><i>I just have the feeling that if Obama were white, this would not be an issue. </i></p>
<p>I just have the feeling that playing the race card is the go-to defense mechanism for Obama supporters, as it was for the Obama campaign. I just have the feeling that when people questioned McCain&#8217;s citizenship, it was politics-driven, not race-driven. But if Obama&#8217;s citizenship is questioned, it&#8217;s all about race.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s not true, I just think that many racists are behind this citizenship inquiry and they are afraid to admit they are racist so they are using his &#8220;questionable&#8221; citizenship as a way to direct their racial animus against him without having to resort to name-calling.</p>
<p>I think if Obama were white there would not be this line of inquiry. We didn&#8217;t see this brought up with any white president-elects before, after all. That is why I have a stronger argument here.</p>

	<p>I can&#8217;t either, but we&#8217;ve never had a candidate with Obama&#8217;s background. This isn&#8217;t rocket science, and it has nothing to do with race. The constitutional requirements for the job are in question.</p>

	<p><i>I cannot think of any president-elect where there was this line of inquiry.</i></p>
<p>It was brought up long, long before he became President-elect &#8211; it was in fact at least contemporary with the questions about McCain. And it&#8217;s not our fault Obama became President-elect before the questions were satisfied.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s anything to this line of inquiry, but I certainly don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s race driven. That&#8217;s the typical accusation of political and racist bigots. And that&#8217;s a group where you certainly belong.</p>

	<p>nicedeb,</p>
<p>The main difference Obama has in background in regards to other president-elects is the color of his skin. </p>
<p>I believe that this citizenship inquiry derives mainly from the narrative among conservative people &#8212; who in my part of the country tend to be racist and xenophobic about other cultures &#8212; who feel that because Obama is black, he is less American.</p>
<p>I have had this accusation made against me due to my skin color and name, even though I was born in USA, so I have some experience with this. When confronted with darker complexions in combination with a foreign sounding name, conservative/less-worldly people tend to assume we were not born in USA.</p>
<p>I am not saying that to offend anyone, just to point out that this is how it is for many ethnic natural born Americans like myself and Mr. Obama.</p>

	<p>Samir, you really have no idea how insulting you&#8217;re being, do you? You are painting with a very broad brush, and I&#8217;m losing patience with it. I don&#8217;t know what part of the country you live in, but I don&#8217;t know any conservatives like the ones you describe.  </p>
<p>The citizenship issue stems from his Kenyan father, and theories he was born in Kenya, and years he spent in Indonesia. And the fact that he refuses to produce his birth certificate as opposed to a certification reproduced on websites. </p>
<p>When McCain&#8217;s citizenship was in question, he quickly produced his birth certificate. Obama has not done that because there&#8217;s apparently something on there he doesn&#8217;t want made public. </p>
<p>Really, stop playing the race card. It&#8217;s annoying, and profoundly wrong.</p>

	<p><i>I’m the minority here</i></p>
<p>Playing the race card yet again. It&#8217;s obviously second nature for you. And, of course, it has absolutely no relevance to your bigotry.</p>
<p><i>I believe this whole line of inquiry is based on the color of Obama’s skin, and that if he were white, it would not have gotten legs.</i></p>
<p>And, as we&#8217;ve said repeatedly, replete with supporting examples, you&#8217;re quite wrong. NiceDeb and I don&#8217;t even agree on the subject, but we don&#8217;t leap to the assumption that the other&#8217;s views are driven by race.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;re not bigots.</p>

	<p>nicedeb,</p>
<p>I think the race card must be played when race is ultimately the main factor in the majority of those who are supporting this inquiry. I do believe there are conservatives and Republicans who are not racist. I will assume that those are not the ones following this inquiry.</p>
<p>Why do I think racism is at hand here? It is because Obama&#8217;s skin pigmentation is a lot darker than the previous ones, and because his father was from Africa, which is a region generally despised by conservatives in USA.</p>
<p>I can only conclude that it is racial paranoia which keeps supporters of this inquiry going; laying out of facts appear not to stop the inquiry. </p>
<p>The one fact that would have stopped the inquiry in a rational, critical mind is that: Obama was born in USA to a non-citizen father and a citizen mother &#8212; this makes him a citizen at birth, or, in other words, a natural born USA citizen.</p>
<p>I would know, since I was born to a non-citizen father and a citizen mother and have been a natural born USA citizen since birth as well.</p>
<p>Since you continue the inquiry, again I can only conclude that you know these facts but are motivated by a deep-seated hostility, however subtle, against other races, nationalities and ethnicities.</p>
<p>I hope you will learn the error of thinking this way and end the inquiry &#8212; not because Obama is a Democrat and not because I support him, but because it is furthering ignorance and denialism, not unlike the so-called Holocaust denial syndrome and 9/11 denial movement.</p>

	<p><i>if you are going to engage in this citizenship inquiry with no proof of your allegations whatsoever.</i></p>
<p>Try to keep up, Samir. If you had comprehended what I wrote previously, you&#8217;d have realized that I don&#8217;t support the inquiry.</p>
<p>And regarding &#8220;proof of allegations,&#8221; all we&#8217;ve heard from you is that you &#8220;feel&#8221; that racism is the motivating force for the inquiry. </p>
<p><i>The one fact that would have stopped the inquiry&#8230;blah, blah, blah</i></p>
<p>Again you show poor reading comprehension: apparently the gist of the arguments in this matter has sailed completely over your head. Since you are obviously incapable of following the discussion on the thread, or even of understanding the post, I&#8217;ll leave you to your bigotry and fancies of imagined racism.</p>

	<p>Don&#8217;t bother, ND &#8211; the point of the post was that the Kenyan ambassador said that Obama was born in Kenya (and of course you posted the retraction more than 2 weeks ago). Samir can&#8217;t get past his one-dimensional &#8220;if he was born in the US, you must be a racist&#8221; argument.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the whole point of the post was to question whether he&#8217;d been born in the US.</p>
<p>Watching him follow that trail of illogic made me throw up my hands and move on.</p>

	<p>Story is that Obama is a black man who has a past that enables US citizens to feel estranged to him.<br />
Using the Rice, Keyes&#8230; cards is fallacious at most because contrary to those people, Obama can claim an African heritage, a heritage that is real and not a imaginary one.<br />
People are depicting racists as being stupid. What racist would start an enquiry of citizenship on Rice? It would be stupid. Obama has this past story that enabled racists to exploit this or that point. Rice is totally disconnected from Africa. She does even not know where she is from, what here real name is, who they are. She is an African just as I am, save that my ancestors were in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago.<br />
Yep, if people came with a person having a similar background, opening the possibility of similar attacks and that they did not happen, they could rule out racism from the picture. Simply comparing Keyes, Rice&#8217;s&#8230; background to Obama&#8217;s background is a failure. Obama&#8217;s father is a true African. His mother happened to go to Africa.<br />
These other guys never put a foot outside of the US since late in their life, are called African when they are just as African as me, just to soothe a bitter past which cut their roots. I really wonder how somebody can make something out of this kind of background to build up an attack, no matter how racist this somebody is.</p>

	<p>The fact that Obama&#8217;s father was an African citizen &#8211; not an American one, and he may have been born overseas, and that he steadfastly refuses to show his birth certificate, (spending untold millions on lawyers to help him win these court cases without having to show it) makes this a valid question. Period. Stop the race baiting. It&#8217;s stupid, and boring.</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger isn&#8217;t a natural born citizen, either and is not qualified to be President, even though he&#8217;s the governor of California. {{{{He&#8217;s white}}}}</p>

	<p>Well, well, I would not break people&#8217;s illusions here but how does Schzarzenegger&#8217;s case is connected to Obama&#8217;s case?<br />
Was it a mystery that this guy was not born within the US?</p>
<p>First people put up the case of Rice, Keyes and others who are only African by a substitution of identity trick: these people do not know what their ancestors&#8217; names were, dont know where they come from, dont know a word of any african language, probably not even step in Africa&#8230;Yet they are African americans. Laughable. How can somebody really think of putting up an attack on their birth location like claiming they were born somewhere in Africa? Again people on this page paint racist people as silly people. They are not. Racist people usually opt for attacks that might be disguised as true. They dont want to be dismissed in a second but want to get the light spot on them.<br />
Schwarzenegger&#8217;s case appeal is ridiculous. No mystery that the guy was born in Austria. Again, somebody claiming that it was not the case would be reduced to stupid level in a second.</p>
<p>There is nothing like an african citizen. Africa is a continent that is not a country-nation. So far, you can only be a citizen from a country-nation.</p>
<p>Most important, I never heard that somebody innocent has to produce evidences of his innocence and I thought that innocence was the default status.</p>
<p>People have to provide convincing evidences that Obama is not a US born citizen. Where are they?</p>
<p>Again this breach in what is supposed to be a core principle in the US smells of racism. Better, even when this stuff is dismissed and that people are provided with counter evidences (a disgrace since this guy should not have to put up anything until convincing evidences indicting him was produced), people still want more.</p>
<p>Get a grip: racism has been driven this demand so far.<br />
It was legit to wonder about this man&#8217;s citizenship in case of convincing evidences were produced. None were produced. Still some counter-evidences were produced in a desperate attempt to establish innocence. As usual, since guiltiness is what must be established and not innocence , this attempt failed and there are still people who are still clinging to the idea. Driven by what? Racism. Either that or deep stupidity and racist people are not stupid.</p>

	<p><i>People have to provide convincing evidences that Obama is not a US born citizen. </i></p>
<p>The evidence would be on his birth certificate, you maroon. The fact that the location of his birth is &#8220;a mystery&#8221; (unlike Schwarzenegger&#8217;s) is the reason for the controversy. It has nothing to to with the color of his skin. What I believe has driven many people to these desperate attempts to have him disqualified  is an acute distrust of the man&#8217;s character based on observations throughout the campaign, and his far left Socialism.</p>
<p>Really, you have absolutely no evidence  for your racism charge, and your arguments are becoming increasingly incoherent.</p>

	<p>Yes, that is that.<br />
From this very own page, how does it come that a guy seems to be so certain that  Barack Obama was born in Hawai`i, August 4, 1961 at Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu? How is this a mystery? Do people have convincing evidences that Obama is not born at this told location?<br />
I am waiting for an answer before addressing the racism question.</p>

	<p>This thread has got to be stopped.<br />
First, we are a country that would like to keep &#8220;the law the law&#8221;  unlike most foreign countries I have lived in. The &#8216;right-wing bloggers&#8217; which are so despised for expressing FREEDOM OF THOUGHT do not like the prez&#8217;s politics. I think that is why they question his eligibility. As far as I kno, THIS IS STILL AMERICA and there is nothing wrong with questioning that. If he is eligible, which he seems to be since he&#8217;s been sworn in, then it&#8217;s a moot point.<br />
Secondly, the &#8220;racist&#8221; argument is a red herring (a red herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue).  So drop it.<br />
Thirdly, you cannot &#8216;prove&#8217; a negative-and that is what race-baiting is. In race-baiting, I cannot prove my accuser isn&#8217;t, either!  This is a waste of time and space. Accusations like that are welcomed in a chat rooms, if that&#8217;s your style. .<br />
Third, my husband was a diplomat-and according to him a child born outside the US _may_ be an American citizen, but there are _certain procedures_ &#8211; and they have changed through the years.<br />
Fourth, I have lived several times in Kenya. The first was only about 10 years after their indepence from Britain. I have a feeling, knowing the Kenyan history and circumstances, that Obama was indeed born in HI (which became a state in 1959).<br />
Finally, the great irony-and this has nothing to do with race, but within Kenya, the tribe from which his father&#8217;s tribe, the Luos, are the ones which have always tried to gain the presidency but never have succeeded.<br />
Here is a twist: Kenya is not fraught with race problems, but tribal problems. While Kenyans rejoiced that a fellow Kenyan became president, I feel there were Kikuyus wondering why it wasn&#8217;t a fellow Kikuyu.  Luos are also known in Kenya as great showmen, often protrayed as talking on dead cell phones while in public view.<br />
Also, many Luos are Muslim by birth, but not by &#8216;faithful&#8217;  to Islam at all.  </p>
<p>, the President&#8217;s mother is</p>

	<p><i>Barack Obama was born in Hawai`i, August 4, 1961 at Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu.</i></p>
<p>Actually the hospital Obama was born in has been in dispute. Some sources say that he was born at Queens medical Center.</p>
<p><a href="http://genealogy.wikia.com/wiki/Barack_Obama_(1961)" rel="nofollow">http://genealogy.wikia.com/wiki/Barack_Obama_(1961)</a></p>
<p>Also, I have never forcefully argued one way or the other that Obama wasn&#8217;t born in Hawaii. But I do maintain that it is very odd and suspicious that he refuses to show his original birth certificate, and has spent a lot of money to keep it under wraps. Whether or not it&#8217;s legally incumbent upon him to prove to a doubting citizenry that he is indeed, a natural born citizen is a not the point. It would seem the natural, common sense response to the question.</p>

	<p>My husband&#8217;s &#8220;professional&#8221; friends couldn&#8217;t understand a lot about the President&#8217;s extended family. Mostly because There is no legal analogy in the United States. Men &#8216;take&#8217; wives &#8211; and the marriage license may be irrelevant (indeed, in my experience, getting paperwork through there has been a morass). Secondly, many men &#8216;take another wife&#8217; prior to or instead of divorcing a previous wife. Finally, the word &#8220;family&#8221; (including cousin) needs to be interpreted in its loosest sense.</p>

	<p>I read the post but nowhere I see convincing evidences going against the default status.</p>
<p>I can go very easily with this kind of thinking pattern.</p>
<p>Guy A &#8221; I believe that you are torturing somebody in your basement. Open it up&#8221;<br />
Guy B: &#8220;Anything convincing to prop up your claim?&#8221;<br />
Guy A: &#8220;Moron! My evidences are in your basement. So open it up now&#8221;</p>
<p>Might even work for WMDs or stuff like that, killing millions&#8230;<br />
Where are those convincing evidences? I need them to address the other point as I am promised.</p>
<p>Somehow pleasing to see how a nation like the US which keep pretending to have built to promote certain values have drifted so far from them&#8230; According of course the US ever promoted these values but this is another story.</p>
<p>The  point on the topic is how does it come that a guy should answer to allegations&#8230;</p>

	<p><i>Where are those convincing evidences? I need them to address the other point as I am promised.</i></p>
<p>You have been wrong from the beginning in assuming that the burden of proof lies with Obama&#8217;s accusers. In fact it lies with Obama, who must prove his qualifications to be President. Personally, I&#8217;m satisfied that he&#8217;s qualified, but it should be trivial for him to satisfy those who don&#8217;t believe it. So why doesn&#8217;t he?</p>
<p><i>Somehow pleasing to see how a nation like the US which keep pretending to have built to promote certain values have drifted so far from them</i></p>
<p>That pleases you? What a grotesque attitude.</p>

	<p><i>The point on the topic is how does it come that a guy should answer to allegations…</i></p>
<p>To not look like he&#8217;s hiding something&#8230;which millions of Americans think he is.</p>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t the only place in the internet to find legitimate questions about Obama&#8217;s citizenship status, and I haven&#8217;t actually covered it much.  For me, the fact that the Ambassador of Kenya had suggested in an interview that Obama was born in Kenya was noteworthy, and that&#8217;s why I wrote a post about it. </p>
<p>It was/is noteworthy.</p>
<p>But if you want to find all of the arguments, there are plenty of sites that post about it almost exclusively. If you&#8217;re that interested in the issue, I suggest you go there. I&#8217;m not an expert on the case, and am no longer even that interested. It&#8217;s a moot point, now.  Do I think Obama is a natural born citizen? I have my doubts. But my main problem with him is that his a lying, corrupt, commie.</p>

	<p>interesting story on a U.S. Congressman that knew Obama as child:<br />
Neil Abercrombie (born June 26, 1938) is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Hawaii’s 1st congressional district since 1991. There he attended classes with and befriended future United States Senator and current United States President Barack Obama’s parents, Ann Dunham and Barack Obama, Sr. As a result, Abercrombie is the only member of Congress to have met Barack Obama when Obama was a child and knows he was born in Hawaii!</p>

	<p>So if Obama&#8217;s birthplace is a national shrine, WHERE IS IT??</p>
<p>I mean, everybody in Kenya knows where it is, so why didn&#8217;t this clown of a &#8220;reporter&#8221; &#8211; who OBVIOUSLY fed the Ambassador a leading question &#8211; ask where it was and GO TO IT?</p>
<p>Because there ISN&#8217;T ANY SUCH SHRINE.</p>
<p>OBVIOUSLY.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what a pack of stupid morons you sound like? That you actually don&#8217;t see holes in a story as gaping as THAT?</p>

	<p>Hey, Doofus, as I noted in my post, Fellhauer was goofing when he asked the question of Ogego&#8230;it wasn&#8217;t meant to be taken seriously, and nobody said anything about a &#8220;shrine&#8221;. I believe the word used, was &#8220;marker&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ogego said &#8220;everyone&#8221; knows where it&#8217;s located, (in Kenya). Nobody forced him to say that. He&#8217;s since backed away from what he said, and the Kenyan government has issued a gag order on Obama&#8217;s relatives from talking about him to reporters.</p>
<p>It all could have been a misunderstanding, but it was certainly newsworthy that the Ambassador of Kenya agreed that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and everybody knew the birthplace.</p>

&#8216;BUT you could not register a child born outside of Hawaii in Hawaii with a registration that she or he was born in Hawaii. In other words, you could get a document saying that this child was born, is the child of so and so, but the document does not and legally cannot say that the child was born at Place A if she or he was born at Place B.&#8221;</p>

	<p>One of the funniest arguments about this is when people insist that the only reason Granny would have put in an announcement about his birth with the newspaper is that she expected him to run for President.  Likewise, the arguments that no one would falsely register his birth to make him a citizen unless they expected him to be POTUSA.  Of course, even the official Obama story has her flying back at the last minute to have her baby born in the USA.  The only difference is whether she made it.</p>
