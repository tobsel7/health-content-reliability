				<p>
  Let's posit that Sarah Palin overstated the case when she warned
  about "death panels" in the House version of Obamacare.
  Obviously, there are no specific provisions in the legislation
  that create all-powerful boards whose members give a thumbs-up or
  thumbs-down on whether or not one person receives life-saving
  care while another one is left to die or even "assisted" in
  dying. But that doesn't mean that fears of government-prompted
  premature deaths are unwarranted. Call it "death by proxy," or
  DBP. Obamacare encourages DBP in multiple ways -- and it's not at
  all unfair to suggest that President Obama himself doesn't really
  mind that prospect.
</p>
<p>
  First, consider the context. We have a president who has such
  extreme, sickening disregard for inconvenient life that he
  <a href="http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000007034.cfm">opposed</a>
  the Born Alive Infant Protection Act in Illinois, thus refusing
  to require hospitals to care for babies who survive an attempted
  abortion. And regarding the other end of life, this is the same
  president who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/magazine/03Obama-t.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">
  told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>' David Leonhardt that
  because "the chronically ill and those toward the end of their
  lives are accounting for potentially 80 percent of the total
  health care bill out here," therefore "I think that there is
  going to have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors,
  scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a
  very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is
  very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just
  through the normal political channels. And that's part of why you
  have to have some independent group that can give you guidance.
  It's not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you
  some guidance."
</p>
<p>
  So this president wants a "conversation" that is "guided by"
  supposed experts who are apart from the "normal political
  channels" but that is nevertheless influenced by "a very
  difficult democratic conversation." Is it any wonder that some
  people interpreted this "independent group" as a "death panel"???
</p>
<p>
  This same president surrounds himself with people who aren't --
  shall we say -- particularly bashful about considering the
  possibility of rationing care so that young adults get priority
  ahead of their grandparents and their would-be children. Yes, the
  president's chief medical policy advisor, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, is
  personally opposed to euthanasia. But the <em>Washington
  Post</em> editorial board protests entirely too much when it
  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/21/AR2009082103327.html">
  absolves</a> him -- without much proof -- of approving the
  rationing of care that disfavors the old and infirm. Frankly, the
  <em>Washington Times</em> <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/16/health-rationing-by-other-names">
  editorial</a> on August 16 blows the <em>Post</em>'s editorial
  out of the water, because there is no way to explain away Dr.
  Emanuel's statement that "allocation by age is not invidious
  discrimination; every person lives through different life stages
  rather than being a single age." From the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60137-9/abstract">
  executive summary</a> of his piece published just this past
  January, this could not be more clear: "We recommend an
  alternative system -- the complete lives system -- which
  prioritises younger people who have not yet lived a complete
  life…."
</p>
<p>
  Then a president who <em>won't</em> save infants born alive but
  who <em>does</em> want the government to be involved (a
  "democratic conversation") in deciding end-of-life treatment --
  and whose medical policy adviser would "prioritise" young people
  -- hires as his chief science adviser a man, John P. Holdren, who
  first gained notoriety pushing eugenics ideas such as coerced
  abortions, forced sterilizations through the water supply, and
  other notions so outrageous that the man should never be accepted
  in polite company again, much less have the ear of the President
  of the United States. Again, the <em>Washington Times</em>
  <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/16/obamas-mad-science-adviser/?feat=article_top10_read">
  summed</a> it up, with a hat tip being appropriate for Internet
  journalist "<a href="http://zombietime.com/john_holdren/">Zombie</a>" via <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/07/10/the-ghoulish-spirit-of-margaret-sanger-lives/">
  Michelle Malkin</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It is in that context that Section 1233 of the main House health
  care bill started catalyzing fears of "death panels." The section
  provides for end-of-life counseling, and it lays out in specific
  form exactly what should be included in that counseling.
  Significantly, the substance of that counseling is not
  negotiable: It "shall" -- not "may" but "shall" -- include all of
  the possibilities that so raised people's fears. As Betsy
  McCaughey <a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2009/08/17/recent-media-coverage-of-the-e">
  noted</a> at this site, the provision also effectively imposes
  sanctions against doctors whose results aren't up to… uh…
  <em>snuff</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This is precisely where the "death by proxy" really comes in. If
  medical personnel are rated on how effective they are at getting
  patients to create living wills and the like, and if independent
  boards are deciding that patients will not be reimbursed for
  their payments for certain forms of care, then the effect is that
  death becomes the default option. DBP, indeed.
</p>
<p>
  Anybody who doubts that such provisions inevitably lead to
  rationing care in a way that subtly favors death need only
  consider that this is exactly what already is happening at the
  state level, not just in "assisted suicide" states like Oregon
  but <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/29/losing-control-of-health-decisions/">
  also in Georgia</a>, as <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/29/a-euthanasia-mandate">
  approved</a> by a federal court. 
</p>
<p>
  Even without the now-infamous Section 1233, rationing does occur,
  frequently, in government-run <em>and</em> government-mandated
  systems. And even without any health care bill, the camel's nose
  already is <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/08/death_panel_is_not_in_the_bill.html">
  under the tent</a> in the form of the Federal Coordinating
  Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research.
</p>
<p>
  Despite what Mr. Obama keeps saying about how extreme
  right-wingers are "distorting" his plans with tales of death
  panels and the like, the truth is that these concerns come from
  all parts of the political spectrum, and that they are valid. The
  <em>Washington Post</em>'s own <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080703043.html">
  Charles Lane</a>, formerly editor of the liberal flagship the
  <em>New Republic</em>, wrote as much a few weeks ago. Lane is
  worth quoting extensively:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Section 1233, however, addresses compassionate goals in
    disconcerting proximity to fiscal ones. Supporters protest that
    they're just trying to facilitate choice -- even if patients
    opt for expensive life-prolonging care. I think they protest
    too much: If it's all about obviating suffering, emotional or
    physical, what's it doing in a measure to "bend the curve" on
    health-care costs? Though not mandatory, as some on the right
    have claimed, the consultations envisioned in Section 1233
    aren't quite "purely voluntary," as Rep. Sander M. Levin
    (D-Mich.) asserts. To me, "purely voluntary" means "not unless
    the patient requests one." Section 1233, however, lets doctors
    initiate the chat and gives them an incentive -- money -- to do
    so. Indeed, that's an incentive to insist.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Lane continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Section 1233 goes beyond facilitating doctor input to
    preferring it. Indeed, the measure would have an interested
    party -- the government -- recruit doctors to sell the elderly
    on living wills, hospice care and their associated providers,
    professions and organizations. You don't have to be a
    right-wing wacko to question that approach.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Noted civil libertarian Nat Hentoff, nobody's example of a right
  winger, goes even further than Lane did, pronouncing himself
  "scared" of Obamacare -- which he says could amount to a
  "chilling climax of the Obama presidency." The Hentoff column,
  linked <a href="http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/hentoff081909.php3">here</a>,
  is well worth reading in full. "No matter what Congress does when
  it returns from its recess," Hentoff accurately writes,
  "rationing is a basic part of Obama's eventual master health care
  plan." Without using the words, what Hentoff describes, and warns
  against, is exactly DBP.
</p>
<p>
  And I dare say the president knows it.

  Mr. Quinn, I agree with the thrust of your argument, but don't
  understand why you feel the need to attack Sarah Palin's
  terminology.
</p>
<p>
  I understand you like the term "rationing", which frankly doesn't
  resonate with many people, while Governor Palin coined the term
  "death panel", which perfectly captures the intent and eventual
  result of the proposed legislation.
</p>
<p>
  It's disheartening to see some conservatives trying to capitalize
  on Sarah's name by posing as her intellectual superiors. That's
  not a winning strategy in my opinion.

  What's with all these wordsmiths who apparently don't understand
  how a metaphor is used? Did this writer bother to read her
  original article, as well as her follow-up?
</p>
<p>
  "Death Panel" was used as a descriptive, an accurate descriptive
  of a collective of various parts of the legislation.
</p>
<p>
  When Reagan used the term "The Evil Empire", did we expect to see
  a big sign at their borders that said "The Evil Empire"? Of
  course not. He used the term because it succinctly described the
  USSR.
</p>
<p>
  Sarah Palin did the same in describing ObamaCare. I'm not a man
  of letters, but even I could understand exactly what she meant.

  This is a policy made by The Kids (using the hippie terminology
  of the Sixties/Seventies) including the Kid In Chief, who believe
  that (1) it is the duty of their parents to die and get out of
  the way, incidentally leaving all their money to TheKids instead
  of spending it wantonly on themselves, and (2) they themselves
  will never be old.
</p>
<p>
  These are the same Kids who believe that there will always be a
  critical mass of adults to keep the wheels turning while they
  personally continue to pursue what adults used to call wine,
  women and songs -- and The Kids call sex, drugs and
  rock&amp;roll;, totally free of responsibility and/or
  consequences.
</p>
<p>
  We adults are watching with interest to see how The Kids can
  pursue these mutually exclusive objectives without causing heads
  to explode.

  It may be slightly off topic, but it's good to have some people
  on your side even when they are really not on your side for the
  right reasons. I don't speak of Sarah Palin here (that's why I
  said this is a bit off topic). I'm referring to our senior
  citizens, some (no, not nearly all, maybe not a majority even) of
  who could be called the "useful idiots" for our side.
</p>
<p>
  I don't truly think many of the seniors who have raised cain (we
  call it hell, but they are more polite) care one bit about the
  limits to Fedzilla's power by the 10th Amendment or the huge rise
  in socialism/beauracracy that this monster will entail. Many are
  not worried about an eventual $50,000,000,000,000 US debt to
  other nations. They just don't want anyone to touch their
  (government boondoggles called:) Medicare and Medicaid. A famous
  man named Abraham Simpson said it best when he stated "I'm old,
  gimme, gimme!" Of course, they don't want a death panel to
  convene on their behalf either, and it doesn't take an idiot to
  be against that.
</p>
<p>
  I, for one, appreciate the help from the seniors (some for good
  reasons and understanding and others not.) We should make sure
  that all of these townhall meetings start around 2 in the
  afternoon, so these folks can get through to their congressmen
  first, then still have time to get to the early bird special by 4
  O'clock to gum down that creamed corn and applesause.

  What amazes me is the extent that the President not misread the
  electorate, but all his agenda to be mishandled to this extent.
  To compound matters, the President gives the impression that he
  enjoys the viscious political hardball fights more than he does
  being Chief Executive. Last weeks "rally to the troops (Acorn,
  union activists, and community organizers), as well as his
  comments to "hit back opponents even harder than they hit you" is
  downright unpresidential, let alone wierd. Many commentators such
  as Peggy Noonan (who is now "shocked" at the President's
  behavior) noted that this President knows all about getting
  elected and nothing about governing. His rapid partisanship,
  which is in lock step with Pelosi and Reid, has done more to
  undermine his agenda than anything the GOP can muster.
</p>
<p>
  Some adult in the Democratic Party, such an elderstatesman (if
  one could be found) needs to have a heart to heart with the
  President. Even if he gets his way and forces victories on
  ObamaCare and Cap and Trade, his administration will have spent 4
  years of his political capital before Christmas. The effects of
  these 2 bills will certainly be a disaster for his party not to
  mention the nation (he could conveivably lose majorities in both
  houses), as instead of unifying the nation he will rip it apart.
  If one considers the foreign threats brewing in all parts of the
  world, this is not the time for the US to be totally preoccupied
  with a President whose political competncy is questioned.
</p>
<p>
  Someone needs to clean house with the WH staff (Emmanual, Axelrod
  et als must go). The President could be a lame duck by next Feb.

  You people REALLY need to take a chill pill. I did NOT go out of
  my way to criticize Sarah Palin. I explained PRECISELY where she
  "overstated the case" withOUT saying, as the left did, that she
  lied. The point, if you would care to read it, is that EVEN if
  Palin "overstated" the case, the essence of what she said IS
  still valid. That's what "let's posit" means: It means that FOR
  PURPOSES OF DISCUSSION, let us make a certain assumption. The
  assumption sets up the discussion. One does NOT need to actually
  accept or deny the assumption in itself; one merely needs to
  accept that the assumption describes the parameters of the
  discussion. In this case, it IS true that the words Palin used
  were not literally correct. The establishment media has had a
  field day pointing that out, and therefore using that literal
  incorrectness to try to blow apart the ESSENCE of her point. I
  therefore was fighting back, saying that even if she is not
  literally correct about "death panels," Obamacare DOES, in
  effect, have the same likely result. Already a mainstream organ,
  Politico, is treating my column as being WITHIN the pale of
  discussion even after having dismissed Palin. In other words, I
  have kept the central argument alive, not buried it. For the
  second straight week, if some of you would stop being so
  defensive, you would see that I am advancing the cause, not
  weakening it. Jeesh.

  When advancing causes, facts are handy. The fact is the whole
  Obama plan is nothing but a death trap for the entire country,
  because all government health care plans lead to the same result,
  rationing.
</p>
<p>
  Rationing by it's very nature leads to less. In some cases it
  would be hard to argue that will lead to success. The lack of
  success in small or large measures in health care has only one
  outcome, failure.
</p>
<p>
  Failure in health care is most likely death or diminished living
  standards, which in some cases will be a vegetative state or
  substandard living in terms of personal health.
</p>
<p>
  The policies of collectivism are all about destroying the
  individual or individual freedoms. So it isn't a question of
  whether death camps are specified, it's a question of whether
  health care will be delivered.
</p>
<p>
  It's a fact that collectivism leads to rationing in just about
  every field. With health care that rationing will only lead to
  poor health care, which in fact, will lead to death.
</p>
<p>
  So, in essence, if you embrace falsehoods about health care, you
  embrace inefficiency in the form of poorer health for the masses.
  Isn't this just the Holocaust lite?

  Hi Dave Lincoln,

  Interesting that you should mention NR. I used to spend a lot of
  time over at NRO, and started spending more time over here when
  NR and NRO got taken over by fauxcon wonks like David Frum (who
  is long gone, but the stench remains). I enjoy John Derbyshire,
  the cranky resident paleocon/Anglican atheist, and a few others,
  but they've gone establishment; Buckley's brainchild is no longer
  truly conservative. Strange and sad days, indeed.
</p>
<p>
  There have been a few ugly shoots of fauxcon/RINOism emerging
  from Amspec over the past year or so. Like weeds, they must be
  quickly and ruthlessly pulled out by the roots . . .

  For those on the Palin bandwagon, I can understand your desire to
  prop her up. The conservative cupbaord is mighty thin.
  Personally, I am no fan of Palin for reasons that have nothing to
  do with politics and more to do with being a parent of small
  children. She allowed her family to be pulled into that pit of
  guttersnipes (aka The Left) because it was a good career move for
  her. As a mother of an infant with Downes, Palin should have
  politely turned McCain down.
</p>
<p>
  But that aside, Govenor Palin is not quite the conservative that
  many think of her. I look at how a person has governed as much as
  what they say (that is why I do not trust Pawlenty, Romney, nor
  Huckabee). Palin may be a reformer of sorts, but her popularity
  in Alaska has more to do with redistributing oil profits to
  Alaskans than anything else. She may be at heart a populist, but
  so was Bill Clinton. She is a gifted politican and may have a
  distinguished career in national politics someday. But like the
  current President, Palin is not ready to sit in the Oval Office.
</p>
<p>
  However, I do give all the credit for getting HR1233 off the
  books. It's too bad none of the establishment Republicans showed
  the same kind of courage.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime it is wise not put too much emotional committment
  to one person. If you want the truth, Sarah Palin in 2009 reminds
  me of another Govenor from the year 1998 -Geroge W Bush. He too
  was thought to be a savior to conservatives way back then. And
  look how that turned out.
</p>

  To Etiquette Man: You have this backwards: "You adopted Palin's
  position. Why not credit her? Why the now-seemingly-obligatory
  cheap shot?"<br />
  Actually, SHE adopted MY position. Both the New York Times and
  MoveOn.org blamed (I take it as credit, not blame) the Washington
  Times editorialists for first mainstreaming the potential for
  "euthanasia." I was the one who drafted the key editorials
  referred to by MoveOn. The first was back in May. The second was
  July 29. It was our editorials, I believe, that brought the issue
  to the fore, AFTER which Palin jumped in -- which also was AFTER
  Gingrich jumped in, by the way. Yes, Palin raised the stakes
  substantially, both for good and for some ill (because her
  formulation of the issue did allow establishment types to
  successfully belittle the whole idea). But people were raising
  hell about end-of-life provisions in the bill, at the town hall
  meetings, BEFORE Palin spoke up. Therefore, she did NOT create
  the issue or even make it a big deal. She made it a BIGGER deal,
  yes, but she was not the first one to the party, so to speak. I
  was well out in advance.

  Hi JP,
</p>
<p>
  With respect, it's not about being on the "Palin Bandwagon"
  (whatever that is--a set from a Dick Clark production, perhaps?).
</p>
<p>
  She surely has her faults (like everyone else ever born--except
  for a certain Nazarene Carpenter), but we are sick and tired of
  hearing about them.
</p>
<p>
  The left eats weak-kneed fauxcons for lunch. It is drooling over
  the prospect of taking out Palin, and peole like Quin and
  Krauthammer are helping the left in that effort.
</p>
<p>
  Quin and his Krauthammerian ilk need to stop bending over
  backwards to make friends on the DC circuit by eating their
  young, viz. up and comers like Palin and Jindal.
</p>
<p>
  I really think that's ALL there is to it. We're just sick and
  tired of having promising folks on our side, whatever their
  faults, criticized by self-annointed elitist "conservatives."
</p>
<p>
  As a great Patriot, inventor, and Farmer's Almanac publisher put
  it long ago: "We must all hang together or we will surely all
  hang separately."

  Both liberals and conservatives are having a very difficult time

  Those journalists and talking heads have gone to great lengths to

  conclusion about “Death Panels.” It’s almost comical, except that
  it is so insulting to Sarah Palin.
</p>
<p>
  On Facebook with two little words she brought complete focus on
  sections and sub-sections within a “health care” bill that has
  stirred up a nation. It hit home so solidly that the language was

  To toot my own horn, I’ve been shouting for over a year now that
  it was a huge mistake to place anyone in charge of reforming
  healthcare who voted to kill newborn American Citizens simply
  because they had the audacity to survive attempted murder on the
  part of their mothers and their abortionists. I was specifically
  referencing obumassiah who as Hillyer reminds us, did so vote
  when a mere illinois senator. On top of that, I hold in my
  formerly sugar coated fingers a document my boss brought home
  from her work and titled, “The Death Book for Veterans.” This is
  an opinion piece by Jim Towey which appeared in the ‘Wall Street
  Journal” on the 19th. Everyone who disagrees with Mrs. Palin’s
  description of death panels should google that article and be
  very afraid. In brief, the article references a Veterans
  Administration pamphlet named ‘Your Life, Your Choices’ which was
  written by Dr. Robert Pearlman, chief of ethics evaluation for
  the VA’s National Center for Ethics in Health Care. In 1996
  Pearlman “advocated for physician-assisted suicide in Vacco vs.
  Quill before the U.S. Supreme Court and is known for his support
  of health-care rationing.” The 52 page booklet “was first
  published in 1997 and later promoted as the VA’s preferred living
  will throughout its vast network of hospitals and nursing homes.
  After the Bush White House took a look at how this document was
  treating complex health and moral issues, the VA suspended its
  use. Unfortunately, under (hes-not-my) President (obumah), the VA
  has now resuscitated “Your Life, Your Choices.”” On page 21 of
  the booklet is a worksheet designed to push American Warriors
  into basically deciding that since they were too uncooperative to
  die of their wounds in battle, they should now do us all the
  favor of making the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Excuse
  me, it’s good health care to kill the most defenseless of us,
  pre-born children and wounded soldiers? I don’t thank so. What
  the golden calf really means is it’s good medical practice to
  kill everyone his homeland security czar thinks is a terrorist or
  leads an inconvenient-according-to-him life so that his union
  thugs and acorn minions can move to the head of the queue. If
  this bill passes, I will be condemned to death. That means I have
  nothing to lose.

  Sarah Palin is now the most prominent conservative bulwark
  against tyranny in our country. Her extraordinary courage and
  resolve demand our support, not our censure.
</p>
<p>
  The media's attack on Sarah Palin's figurative use of the term
  "death panels" is no doubt anticipated given their overwhelming
  bias in favor of Universal health care. It has been amusing to
  hear and read of their literal reading of the healthcare bill
  ("there is no mention of 'death panels'"). But as you have
  demonstrated in this column, Sarah Palin, ahead of everyone else,
  was onto something important and sinister about Obama's plans. It
  has now been revealed that the VA has provided similar death
  preparedness documents to veterans.
</p>
<p>
  I recently cancelled my subscription to NRO for essentially doing
  the same thing you did in this piece, to wit, throwing Sarah
  Palin under the bus while simultaneously agreeing with her
  concerns about the "death panels." Perhaps if she had been more
  nuanced in her facebook comments, RINOs and liberals might like
  her more and we wouldn't have needed this inconvenient
  conversation about Obama's creepy Orwellian healthcare vision.
</p>
<p>
  The fact of the matter is that Citizen Sarah single-handedly
  accomplished what no other American could have accomplished, she
  derailed the wholesale government takeover of the American health
  care system. As conservative Americans who believe in less
  government intrusion, free market capitalism, self-reliance and
  fiscal responsibility, Sarah Palin deserves our thanks and
  appreciation.

  Ah JP, with all due respect, your anger and outrage is seriously
  misplaced when it comes to Gov. Palin. Listen to yourself!! You
  blame Gov. Palin for exposing her family to the "guttersnipes" of
  the Left, simply because, as a public figure, she had a Down
  syndrome child. Might I suggest that if the Left had any shred of
  human decency and decorum, that Gov. Palin's child would never
  have been brought up, other than in admiring and flattering ways.
  Substitute Hillary Clinton with a Down child and imagine the
  fawning praise of the Left for a woman with such courage who can
  still do it all, and with such heavy burdens!! The very essense
  of what NOW has held up as THE female role model. Oh, but we're
  talking conservative here, so the NOW gang flips its morality
  like cheap whores.<br />
  And WHY exactly should Gov. Palin have turned McCain down? Should
  the same apply to a male pol with a special needs child? Funny, I
  don't hear from the dispicable Left any ridicule directed towards
  "Two Americas" John Edwards and how he should abandon the
  political arena, given his bi-costal family structure.<br />
  Gov. Palin, for precisely who and what she is as a woman and
  leader, has captured the hearts of true conservatives. She is, as
  I've said ad nauseam, the real deal. What the Left HATES about
  her, we conservatives LOVE. So JP, best wishes, and I hope to see
  you on the campaign trail.... in 2012!!

  Hey guys. My two cents:
</p>
<p>
  Honestly, I didn't see any signs of an attack on Sarah. The way I
  read the article, Mr. Hillyer was putting up a hypothetical
  situation.
</p>
<p>
  "Let's posit that Sarah Palin overstated the case when she warned
  about "death panels" in the House version of Obamacare.
  Obviously, there are no specific provisions in the legislation
  that create all-powerful boards whose members give a thumbs-up or
  thumbs-down on whether or not one person receives life-saving
  care while another one is left to die or even "assisted" in
  dying. But that doesn't mean that fears of government-prompted
  premature deaths are unwarranted."

  on life, not death, and when death is imminent I help the dying

  The Cheerful Oncologist: You are exactly right. I don't see how a
  physician can resort to encouraging anyone to end living. My
  thoughts the other day while walking in the beautiful weather
  were, "I so much like living, how an I ever going to like dying?"
</p>
<p>
  To David Lincoln: Not all of us old geezers gum our food to death
  and not all of us old geezers wanted any of the Great Society.
  The politicos did it to us so be careful of alienating the very
  ones who are in a position to clean up the "mess" as Obama says.
  I just wish we have elected one who was of the generational era
  to be affected by this legislation. Reading between your lines, I
  almost think you are gleeful about the whole damn situation.
</p>
<p>
  As far as death panels go, I believe that when a person actually
  reads the bill the ideals and ideas coalesce into a thought
  process identifying the basic fact that 27 people appointed by
  the president and the Comptroller will control the
  distribution/delivery of health care services. This is in
  addition to a "health commissioner" who will have the exclusive
  authority (not subject to any court reviews) to implement his
  directives.
</p>
<p>
  I would like to see someone, anyone, contact Mr. David Walker
  (former Comptroller) and Mr. Peter Peterson of the Peterson
  Foundation about their views on this whole health care
  legislation.
</p>
<p>
  They are the ones who started the ball rolling with their
  documentary I. O. U. S. A. and the dissemination that SOMETHING
  has to be done and done now. I wonder what they are thinking and
  I wonder just how much input they had into this bill.
</p>
<p>
  I think the appointment of the "comptroller of the U.S." to a
  position of power to determine what benefits are covered for
  Americans pretty much says it all.

  JP, you're wrong: Palin is not a squish like George W. It was
  immediately obvious to me that Bush was a RINO when he peddled
  his offensive "Compassionate Conservative" garbage in 2000. I
  don't get that mushy vibe from Sarah--at all. I don't know what

  Only a ridiculous fool would blame Sarah for the Drive by Media's

</p>
<p>
  The leftist MSM double standard regarding the treatment of Repub
  and Demo candidates' children is outrageously unfair. If we
  continue to stupidly blame this media injustice on our Republican
  candidates, it will only worsen; and it will not end at the Palin

  If indeed, Mr. Hillyer is patronizing Ms. Palin, this is very
  good news.
</p>
<p>
  She actually insults the lot of you with her dumbing down the
  discourse.
</p>
<p>
  Death Panels. Nice polticial buzz word.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to talk about Death Panels, try addressing the ones
  we already have. They wear suits, for the most part, work for the
  claims department of each and every health care provider in the
  land, and make the exact same choices outlined the government
  plan.
</p>
<p>
  An every day example, something almost each and every one of us
  has probably had to grapple with (or very well may). Granny has
  an individual health care policy and has a horrible disease which
  is nearing the end stages. There is an horrifically expensive (as
  they all seem to be) experimental drug which could help her out
  but it isn't covered by her current policy. She has two choices,
  come up with the money herself, or not get the treatment. Are any
  of you naive enough to think her insurance company is going to
  pony up for it? No, you're not. And I'm not either.
</p>
<p>
  Insurance companies are in business to make money, and they can't
  make money spending every last available cent seeking out every
  last treatment for each and every infirm person under their
  tutelage.
</p>
<p>
  The government program wouldn't be any different.
</p>
<p>
  That said, I do agree that ANYTHING government run, usually runs
  quite poorly. Therefore, I'm not sure I like the idea of a
  National Health Care system.
</p>
<p>
  But don't let the absurd rhetoric blind you to the current
  system's limitations.
</p>
<p>
  There are currently a finite amount of resources and our
  population increases and gets older by the minute.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure we have time to talk about Death Panels when we
  could be having a proper discussion about what can/can't
  should/shouldn't happen with health care.

  Quin, as I stated in my first post, I enjoyed your article, and
  it is a fine analysis. "Death By Proxy" is quite a good phrase,
  and I hope one that also resonates with the American people.
</p>
<p>
  Gov. Palin in her articles has clearly identified the sources for
  her view, she has not pretended to have been the first or even
  10th to become concerned - you are as you say both on the same
  side.
</p>
<p>
  But, although you as a political journalist may not use or like
  the term for whatever reason, Gov. Palin is a politician, and one
  who knows how to effectively focus public attention on "govt
  control-&gt;bending the cost curve-&gt;rationing-=death panels."
  Isn't distilling a message to its simplest form what a good
  politician should do? The fact that the MSM and the WH are upset
  about the term, and are having trouble refuting it according to
  several polls, is a major victory in itself.

		<h2><strong>Etiquette Man</strong><span>|</span> 8.24.09 @ 9:56PM</h2>
			<p>
  Let me take one final stab at this. Apparently, it is not
  possible to make this simple point simply enough for Quin to
  understand.
</p>
<p>
  Let's say that Quin had changed JUST the first sentence.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than the smarmy, "Let's posit that Sarah Palin overstated
  the case when she warned about "death panels" in the House
  version of Obamacare," let's "posit" that he had written, "Sarah
  Palin has taken a great deal of heat for her coining of the term
  'Death Panels,' but even a cursory analysis of the relevant
  provisions in the House bill bear out her use of the term." (He
  could even have added, "As I pointed out in my scintillating
  editorial . . ." if that would have been balm for his bruised
  ego.)
</p>
<p>
  The second version would have been fully consistent with Quin's
  piece.
</p>
<p>
  Let's also "posit" that Quin really DID come up with the idea
  that Sarah ran with.
</p>
<p>
  It would also have given SUPPORT to the<br />
  "misunderestimated" (to use a Bushism) politician who has
  amplified the underlying point that we'll assume was really
  Quin's brainchild, and in the process would have made Quin look
  even more prescient and brilliant than the already thinks he is.
</p>
<p>
  THAT is what makes Quin's "positing" offensive, gratuitous, and
  obviously condescending. He was so intent on bringing Sarah down
  a peg that he was willing to go down one two.
</p>
<p>
  That's not exactly being a "team player," Quin old boy.
</p>
<p>
  Why grant ANY point, even for the sake of argument, that makes
  our side even slightly weaker? What possible reason could any
  true conservative have for doing that?
</p>
<p>
  Why would a real conservative, with his eyes on the prize (rather
  than on a Krauthammerian sinecure as the "reasonable"
  conservative on MSNBC and state controlled media generally)
  refuse to give someone making THE EXACT SAME POINT HE IS an
  "attagirl" rather than a smarmy backhand?
</p>
<p>
  With friends like Quin . . .
</p>

<p>
  Quin still doesn't get it, though, which marks him as a GOP
  loyalist/RINO/fauxcon to me.

  I agree with you Etiquette man. It seems like so many
  conservatives in media have this urge to kiss a__ once in a
  while. They may call it "being civil", but 2 things: 1) That is
  not what being civil means - granting the opposing side some
  points unilaterally and 2) The other side never does this.
</p>
<p>
  By saying something that is sort of down on Sarah Palin in the
  beginning, Quinn can get his bonafides, if you will. It makes him
  feel part of the club and smarter than some simple housewife
  (and, uhhh, former governor) in Alaska. As I said, Quinn may be
  indeed smarter than Mrs. Palin, but, see, Mrs. Palin is in a
  position to do something, that is get people motivated, raise
  money, etc. She is on the right track, and she may know that to
  put the term "death panels" in it's more policy-wonk terms would
  slow down the message, and call it what you want, it is no lie
  (you state that in your article, so no problem there).
</p>
<p>
  The pundits that you don't see do this sort of thing are Ann
  Coulter, Michelle Malkin, and Pat Buchanan. Maybe there are
  others, but I think many are just bucking for another job, and
  when that job comes around, they may do a 180 and they could then
  be hell-bent for socialism. "Hey, it's just my job; nobody said I
  have to believe in it." I say, get a real job in that case. (not
  talking to Quinn here.)

  PCP Smoker, your comment merely reiterates my point, the rhetoric
  does nothing to futher the discussion.
</p>
<p>
  If the American people choose to keep the system as it is, that
  is fine with me. As I said, I doubt the Feds could run an
  efficient health care system.
</p>
<p>
  Also, I am, thankfully, gainfully employed, which I thank my
  lucky stars for in this economic climate. I have good coverage.
</p>
<p>
  That said, my folks a few years back, retired a few years early
  (and worked their arses off in order to be able to do so), and
  their combined, individual monthly health care payments were more
  than my mortgage at the time. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with
  middle class Americans working the better part of their lives in
  order to turn around and pay a good chunk of it to insurance
  companies. That's rubbish.
</p>
<p>
  Can the system be tweaked? Sure. Can we figure out a way to get
  more people insured? I hope so, 'cos the unpaid bills of those
  without coverage are already landing in our, the taxpayers, lap.
</p>
<p>
  Death Panels is just utter sillyness. Everybody and their
  grandmother has a story about being screwed by insurance
  companies, but to listen to you guys, they're the second coming.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not for government run health care, but you'll have to
  forgive me if I don't wish to feed at the trough of the almighty
  insurance company.

  William 5: Sorry, get a clue about the "evil insurance
  companies." They are in the business of being in the business.
  And that means "profits." Some of them operate as cooperatives,
  and the profits part isn't as evil as the ones who operate
  strictly on "profit" for ROI to their shareholders.
</p>
<p>
  Why just today, in the Wall Street, big article about another
  "law" to mandate coverages for mental health on parity with
  "physical" health. How's that for driving up your premiums? You
  get to pay for something, again, that you may never use, but
  because the government demands it, you lose in the long run.
</p>
<p>
  The government has attempted time and time again to "regulate"
  the medical insurance industry until it has choked off any
  resemblance to a "free enterprise" system. So, I guess you'll
  just have to turn your anger against them, to, let's say, the
  legislators (Congress).
</p>
<p>
  How many times do we hear the "evil" this and that when they're
  running for reelection? Then, they get into office and continue
  making laws that affect our bottom line and blame the "evil"
  corporations.
</p>
<p>
  This "circle of love" for their constituents must stop at some
  time.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe the mental coverage for schizophrenia can help them.
</p>
<p>

  Until I was 24 I lived under communism - the operative word here
  is "under". We had two parallel health care systems - one for the
  people and one for the communist elite. Exceptions were possible
  - like my dying father with cancer had to obtain morphium for
  pain; he got it through a friendly doctor and with money bribes.
  Otherwise it was reserved for the ruling elite. The same went for
  complex operations (limited again for the top communists), visits
  to special clinics abroad (the same), etc.

		<h2><strong>William 5</strong><span>|</span> 8.25.09 @ 11:41AM</h2>
			<p>
  Hello Sue...I have a clue about insurance companies (I left out
  'evil', that was your word).
</p>
<p>
  My initial post indicates that insurance companies are in
  business to make money. They therefore cannot be profitable while
  at the same time exhausting every single treatment option for
  every single person under their tutelage.
</p>
<p>
  As I've also mentioned many times in my comments, I am not for a
  nationalized health care system.
</p>
<p>
  I would merely like the rhetoric, from both sides, to be raised a
  few levels. I think there are limitations our current system
  faces which could be addressed. It's quite difficult to get into
  the nuts and bolts when people are running around yelling "no
  Death Panels no Death Panels".
</p>
<p>
  Further, I'm merely pointing out that "Death Panels", the words
  of the right, as described by all the pundits, already exist. I
  think the insurance industry would rather you call them the
  Claims Department, but that is neither here nor there. Either
  way, ultimately, be it a government run, or a private health care
  industry, costs vs. life benefits come into the equation. That's
  what an insurance company has to do to stay in business.
</p>
<p>
  To think otherwise is horribly naive. And I don't think the folks
  on here, including you, are that naive.

  You don't get it, William. If I don't like my insurance company I
  can look for another; once the government is involved I have NO
  recourse.
</p>
<p>
  ObamaCare is one big Death Panel due to rationing. I've read that
  many of the very ill elderly and mentally handicapped are left to
  starve in Britain's hospitals. This is routine.
</p>
<p>
  I believe YOU are very naive if you think health care will
  improve if the government takes over.

  It's amazing the pre-occupation that the Obamaites have with
  Death and its care and feeding. Can you imagine the hue and cry
  if Bush or Reagan had advocated such a "possibility"? Death Panel
  is a quick encapsulation of the effect of these death-style
