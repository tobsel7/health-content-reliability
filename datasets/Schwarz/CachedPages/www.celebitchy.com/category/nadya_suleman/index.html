So Octomom is on Oprah tonight and I&#8217;m going to be completely honest with you - I am covering it now so I don&#8217;t have to watch the whole f&#8217;ing thing. I&#8217;m kind of a perfectionist and I&#8217;ll watch all of Octomom&#8217;s lies and write them down and make fun of them individually, like I did for <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/92564/octomom_still_insane_im_not_crazy_im_not_on_anything/">her cackling appearance on <em>The View</em></a>. We already know that she&#8217;s going to spout her psychobabble and lie through her capped teeth about why she got pregnant with all those embryos and how she makes it through the days with 14 kids. Oprah might call her on some of her bullsh*t, like the women did on the View, but ultimately Suleman will have yet another platform for her lies and warped version of the truth. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even want to read <a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-Interviews-Nadya-Suleman">all the details on Oprah.com</a>, but I just did and it&#8217;s more of the same from Suleman. Oprah even praises her for being &#8220;insightful&#8221; when she repeats the same dimestore Psych 101 crap she&#8217;s spouted since she earned celebrity status by having a whopping eight babies at once. Suleman never wanted to be famous, she doesn&#8217;t want the spotlight, she&#8217;s just trying to make money for her kids, etc. </p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2010/04/20/octomom-nadya-suleman-oprah-video/">TMZ has a clip</a> that shows some of the footage aired on Oprah after cameras spent 24 hours inside that chaotic home that Suleman <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/95625/octomom_alleges_her_home_was_damaged_and_thats_why_shes_not_paying_mortgage/">isn&#8217;t paying for</a>. One of her older children, a girl named Clarissa, is shown deliberately stepping on one of the one year-old Octuplets. In another scene, Nadya threatens one of her sons who wants to sleep in by telling him that CPS will take him away if he doesn&#8217;t go to school. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/suleman3.jpg" alt="suleman3" title="suleman3" width="300" height="205" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-98532" /><br />
We&#8217;ll see this trainwreck soon enough, and here are more advanced details, courtesy of Entertainment Tonight. (<a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-Interviews-Nadya-Suleman/2">Oprah.com also has the details</a> of the interview.) I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s taken so long for Oprah to get this interview, and frankly I&#8217;m disappointed that she gave this woman a platform. She <a href="http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/04/19/monique-brother-molest/">had a pedophile on her show yesterday</a>, though, so it&#8217;s not like her standards are high: </p>
<blockquote><p>Nadya Suleman went on &#8220;The Oprah Winfrey Show&#8221; to offer an inside look into her life as a single mother of 14 children, calling her decision to have so many kids &#8220;selfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was caught up in my own selfish desires. &#8230; I feel as though I wasn&#8217;t thinking,&#8221; Nadya tells Oprah of her decision to get in vitro fertilization, thus impregnating her with eight babies. &#8220;I believe that perhaps I&#8217;ve always coveted that connection to another person. &#8230; You can&#8217;t regret children.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says of learning she was pregnant with octuplets, &#8220;I never could have conceptualized something like this would happen. &#8230; I would never have done this on purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>The octuplet mom says she just works to keep her family afloat, saying they&#8217;re in the &#8220;midst of survival.&#8221; She tells Oprah that she can never give her children enough attention. &#8220;I have a tremendous amount of guilt. &#8230; They have all have different unique needs. &#8230; I live in guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked if she&#8217;s ever considered putting some of her kids up for adoption, she says firmly, &#8220;I will do anything in my power to, without exploiting my children, create revenue. &#8230; I know that sounds selfish but I breathe for my children.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was also asked if Nadya will ever reveal the father of her kids, of which she replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s not my place.&#8221; As for dating, Nadya says that is out of the question for now. &#8220;How could I even fathom taking an ounce of energy from them and giving it to a stranger?&#8221;</p>
<p>She says if she had to do it all over, knowing what she knows now, she might have transferred in less embryos. &#8220;I never wanted more than six, seven children total.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> [From <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2010/04/86088/index.html">Entertainment Tonight</a>]</p>
<p>In the clip of the show that&#8217;s available on Oprah.com Octomom admits that she made $100,000 for <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/88770/star_octo-mom_insists_her_bikini_body_isnt_the_result_of_surgery/">the bikini photos in Star Magazine</a>, but says that the money is gone already. I doubt she spent it on <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/94985/octomoms_latest_home_could_get_foreclosed/">her overdue mortgage</a>. </p>
<p>In regards to that last quote, &#8220;<em>I never wanted more than six, seven children total</em>,&#8221; Nadya&#8217;s ex publicist says that&#8217;s not true at all, and that <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/88881/octomom_had_11_embryos_implanted_to_get_rich_famous_ex_publicist_claims/">she told him that she had 11 embryos implanted</a> in a deliberate and reckless attempt to get rich and famous. He said &#8220;<em>Nadya’s plan was always to make money out of her amazing pregnancy</em>.&#8221; </p>
<p>Dr. Oz lit into Suleman last year and it&#8217;s a shame that Oprah didn&#8217;t let him question her. He called her &#8220;<a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/38486/dr_oz_on_octomom_selfishly_delusional_/">selfishly delusional</a>&#8221; when her dad was on last February. He also said that deliberately getting pregnant with so many babies was cruel. Here are Oz&#8217;s statements at the time: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Ultimately this is a form of cruelty [to the children]. [Nadya is] a very bright woman, but selfishly delusional.</p>
<p>“There is a relatively small chance that all eight of those kids will grow up to be normal adults. There’s going to be a chance of cerebral palsy, developmental delays, emotionally, mentally, vision problems, hearing problems. These kids would fit into my palm. To think that they would be able to grow normally despite being in the hospital and getting all this care they’ve got is unlikely.”</p>
<p>“This is a major failure in professionalism. What the physician did… was not fair. When you put six embryos in a patient you now have seven patients… you risk those lives by implanting them all at the same time.”</p></blockquote>
<p> [From Dr. Oz's appearance on Oprah, 2/24/09]</p>
<p><img src="http://www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sulemanfamily.jpg" alt="sulemanfamily" title="sulemanfamily" width="600" height="238" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-98534" /><br />
Despite what Oz said about Suleman last year, Oprah went relatively easy on her from what I can tell, which reminds me of the <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/80267/octomoms_sympathetic_profile_in_the_ny_times_-_what_the_hell_were_they_thinking/">disgustingly glowing piece</a> The NY Times ran on her several months ago. Suleman did have a platform for her lies, and here are the ones that stuck out for me:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I have never been on welfare. I have not had plastic surgery. I have never wanted to look like some celebrity. I&#8217;ve never wanted fame. I need the truth out there. Why? Because it&#8217;s deleterious. It&#8217;s affecting my children</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think having this woman for a mother is affecting her children way more than some stories that were printed in the tabloids months ago, many of which were proven true. (She didn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35708/octuplet_mom_nadya_suleman_before_plastic_surgery_gets_food_stamps_child_disability/">have plastic surgery</a>? She <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35708/octuplet_mom_nadya_suleman_before_plastic_surgery_gets_food_stamps_child_disability/">wasn&#8217;t on welfare</a>?) It&#8217;s not like people are even paying that much attention to her at this point anyway. </p>

<p>Brace yourselves, fans of the Oprah.  The Almighty is going to be interviewing Nadya Suleman (Octomom) next week, on April 20.  Even though Oprah has done a sit-down interview with Nadya’s parents (that poor father, I felt bad for him), <em>Star Magazine </em>is reporting that this interview will be Oprah and Nadya, one on one, via satellite (or Skype, whatever).  Apparently, this junk has already been taped, and in addition to the satellite interview, Oprah also sent a camera crew to Nadya’s home to film her with her children.  Oh, this is going to be epic television.  CB already wondered if Nadya will <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/92564/octomom_still_insane_im_not_crazy_im_not_on_anything/">cackle insanely during the interview</a>, like she did when she went on <em>The View</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Octomom Nadya Suleman is going one-on-one with Oprah Winfrey. </p>
<p>The mother of 14 has taped an interview to air on The Oprah Winfrey Show on April 20. According to her lawyer, a film crew came to Nadya&#8217;s La Habra, Calif., home last week to see how the supersized family is doing. Nadya then filmed a private interview via satellite from Los Angeles. </p>
<p>The single mom is also making an appearance in a skit for American Idol&#8217;s Idol Gives Back charity show on April 21. </p></blockquote>
<p>[From <a href="http://www.starmagazine.com/octomom_on_oprah/news/16748">Star Magazine</a>]</p>
<p>Oprah has been heavy with some high-profile “gets” lately.  She’s also got <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/96854/oprah_scores_rielle_hunters_first_television_interview/">a big interview with Rielle Hunter set for May</a>, which will be Rielle’s first big interview, post-scandal.  Nadya isn’t as big a “get” as Rielle, but still, I think many of us have been waiting for Oprah to passively-aggressively, judgily (not a word, but it fits for Oprah) interview Nadya.  I bet Oprah will be making her faces.  You know the ones.  When you can tell she’s thinking “This bitch is crazy” and you can it as “I smelled something” on her face.  This will be classic television, I promise.  </p>

Octomom Nadya Suleman is facing foreclosure after her father, the owner of the home where she lives with her 14 children, <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/94985/octomoms_latest_home_could_get_foreclosed/">failed to make a $450,000 balloon payment</a> that was due in mid March. Suleman has been offered a lucrative contract with porn company Vivid that <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/22/2010-03-22_octomom_nadya_suleman_offered_to_have_overdue_mortgage_payments_paid_off_in_exch.html">would pay off her mortgage entirely</a>, but we haven&#8217;t heard whether she&#8217;ll take them up on their offer. Instead of going for the easy money by showing off her scientifically enhanced baby-maker, Suleman and her family are using the survival route they&#8217;ve relied on for decades - they&#8217;re scamming and conniving. According to Radar Online, they&#8217;re threatening the last homeowner with a lawsuit for damages to the home they claims were not disclosed ahead of time. Of course they&#8217;re doing that - they want to get out of paying the nearly half million they owe! Nadya and her father have both <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/38412/octomom_lied_to_her_mother_about_all_pregnancies_said_last_one_was_tumor/">separately</a> <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/40560/octomom_accepts_nursing_care_gets_house_says_she_hasnt_lived_wparents_in_years/">filed for bankruptcy</a> in the past five years and Nadya&#8217;s dad&#8217;s last home was <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/37223/bankrupt_octomoms_house_in_foreclosure_as_she_has_2_nannies_shops_at_mac_and_nordstrom/">similarly foreclosed</a>. He works as an Arabic translator and consultant in the Iraq war, but told Oprah last year <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/38486/dr_oz_on_octomom_selfishly_delusional_/">he had just $100 in his bank account</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>It is business as usual at the La Habra, California Home of Octo-Mom Nadya Suleman, RadarOnline.com has learned. And no foreclosure papers have been served.</p>
<p>Tuesday was the deadline for Nadya’s father Ed Doud to settle a dispute with the previous owner of the house, Amer Haddadin, or face foreclosure.</p>
<p>Haddadin claims that Nadya’s father bought the house a year ago, but hasn’t made good on a $450,000 balloon payment.</p>
<p>Nadya’s mother Angela admitted to RadarOnline.com that Nadya owes money, but the family says what the previous owner did is far worse. And, they are threatening a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Attorney Jeff Czech says “the rain water was improperly drained toward the house, resulting in one head injury to a child along with water damage to personal property.”  Angela claims Nadya has spent thousands on repairs. And Nadya’s father claims the damages were not disclosed in the sale of the home.</p></blockquote>
<p> [From <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/03/exclusive-octo-moms-deadline-comes-and-goes-and-no-foreclosure">Radar Online</a>]</p>
<p>It could be true that there were damages to the home, but given Nadya and her father&#8217;s history of working the system I doubt it. She was also on disability for a bad back and was relying on food stamps when she had artificial insemination and got pregnant repeatedly with her six older children.</p>
<p>There is one way that Suleman and her dad can help pay for their mortgage. She&#8217;s agreed to let <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/03/octo-mom-allows-peta-post-sign-her-front-lawn">PETA put up a sign on her front lawn</a> that says &#8220;Don&#8217;t let your dog or cat become an &#8216;Octomom&#8217; Always Spay or Neuter.&#8221; Suleman will probably use the PETA money toward her next round of IVF. </p>

Octomom was pretty vague about her financial plans for the future when the <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/92564/octomom_still_insane_im_not_crazy_im_not_on_anything/">ladies on <em>The View</em> questioned her repeatedly about it</a>. When she wasn&#8217;t cackling maniacally she was using psychobabble to justify her insane lifestyle, claiming she was in &#8220;denial&#8221; and thought she was just going to have one more baby this last time and &#8220;<em>I could earn enough money as a counselor to take care of them</em> [all seven, if it was just one more].&#8221;</p>
<p>TMZ reports that, just like the last home Suleman shared with her parents, her latest home could be foreclosed. She&#8217;s behind on her mortgage payments and failed to make an agreed-on $450,000 balloon payment. From what I understand, balloon payments are negotiated in order to secure lower monthly mortgage payments. Some homeowners have been <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2008/01/16/584/blimp_payment_the_latest_in_mortgage_fraud">scammed by fine print balloon payment terms</a> in contracts. In this case, given Suleman&#8217;s history of <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/37223/bankrupt_octomoms_house_in_foreclosure_as_she_has_2_nannies_shops_at_mac_and_nordstrom/">bankruptcy</a> and <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/38412/octomom_lied_to_her_mother_about_all_pregnancies_said_last_one_was_tumor/">lying</a> and <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/88881/octomom_had_11_embryos_implanted_to_get_rich_famous_ex_publicist_claims/">scamming</a>, we can probably assume she knew about it and failed to make the payment. </p>
<blockquote><p>Octomom Nadya Suleman and her 14 kids may become homeless &#8230; because she&#8217;s fallen behind on mortgage payments to the tune of more than $450,000 &#8230; this according to the person who holds the note on the property.</p>
<p>Octomom bought the La Habra, CA house in March, 2009. The seller, Amer Haddadin, transferred title to Octo&#8217;s dad. In return, Octo and her dad were required to make monthly payments of $4,139 for one year. On March 10, 2010, a balloon payment of $450,000 was due. </p>
<p>A rep for Amer tells TMZ Octo hasn&#8217;t paid the $450,000. And, he says, she didn&#8217;t make the last $4,139 payment. He also says, she&#8217;s been late on three other recent monthly payments. Amer says he &#8220;tried to handle this in a gentlemanly way&#8221; but unfortunately it&#8217;s come to this.</p>
<p>Amer&#8217;s rep says he intends to initiate foreclosure proceedings against Octomom.</p></blockquote>
<p> [From <a href="http://www.tmz.com/#ixzz0idEKLBOm">TMZ</a>]</p>
<p>I feel sorry for this woman&#8217;s 14 kids, but they&#8217;re already majorly screwed with that whack job as their primary caretaker. Hopefully she&#8217;ll keep some of the nannies around for continuity. Hey, if Octomom needs some cash I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/44584/octomom_nadya_suleman_seriously_considering_offer_from_adult_film_company/">Vivid would make good on their promise to pay her a million bucks</a> to shoot an adult film. It would pay for the home and give her enough left over to keep her staff - if she doesn&#8217;t blow it all within a couple of months. Barring that, she can always go back <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/47741/octomom_was_stripper_for_over_a_year_used_the_alias_angelina/">to stripping</a>. </p>

<p>Octomom Nadya Suleman was a guest on <em>The View </em>this morning. She was truly unhinged. She spoke a mile a minute and laughed so loudly at times that the ladies on the panel looked visibly uncomfortable. Suleman wore a horrendous trashy outfit with a too tight too short abstract print white dress, dark sheer stockings and white wedge boots with fake fur on the top. I was afraid that we were going to see her panties when she sat down and we almost did. When she wasn&#8217;t acting too crazy Suleman was just as shady and slippery with the truth as we&#8217;ve come to expect. At several points she laughed hysterically and inappropriately and you could tell The View ladies thought she was crazy. They even asked her if she was. In terms of what she said, not much of it seemed true. She glossed over her exercise routine, claiming that she only worked out a few days a week. She claimed she never intended to get a bikini body and &#8220;only did it for revenue,&#8221; but one sentence later said she did it to build muscle and not for money. She also said she was media shy! She contradicted herself in her annoying, nasal voice several times during the interview, as if she couldn&#8217;t get her story straight. </p>
<blockquote><p><B>Contradicts herself on why she lost weight</B><br />
Walters: You have exercised three hours a day, you sleep two hours a night. You do exercise right?<br />
Suleman: I do a few times a week<br />
Walters: It was very important for you to lose weight&#8230; With 14 kids was this the most important thing, to be able to wear a bikini?<br />
Suleman: Never. I never, never wanted to do that no. The main reason was obviously for revenue and I&#8217;m the first to admit it. I&#8217;m very very open and honest about that.<br />
Walters: You lost this weight to make money?<br />
Suleman: No I didn&#8217;t! I had to build muscle. Actually every child since my very first. Genetic people love to dismiss genetics particularly the media, because that doesn&#8217;t sell. They&#8217;re gonna just sensationalize everything they can because that&#8217;s gonna sell.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, didn&#8217;t she just say she lost weight to make money and that she went to the gym a few times a week? She can&#8217;t speak for two minutes without contradicting herself. </p>
<blockquote><p><B>On how she&#8217;s going to make money</b><br />
Walters: Right now you&#8217;re getting money&#8230; you&#8217;re not being paid today, you&#8217;re getting money from doing interviews and videos. When that stops, how are you going to support 14 children, 3 nannies?<br />
Suleman: That&#8217;s an extremely good question. From the very beginning I am very naturally shy. And I never wanted anything to do with cameras or the industry. &#8220;That industry&#8221; I used to call it. Ever. I always wanted t be a doctor. So in my mind, being in denial, I thought I could exit the hospital, continue my daily routine, go back and forth to the hospital. Go back to school. And of course, you know, I like to alwys believe life happens to you when you make other plans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you f*cking kidding me? She was &#8220;very naturally shy&#8221;? She <a herf="http://www.celebitchy.com/35923/octuplet_mom_nadya_suleman_denies_obsession_with_angelina_jolie/">sat down with Anne Curry</a> less than a month after the octuplets were born! When Suleman was saying all that crap about not wanting anything to do with &#8220;the industry,&#8221; Joy was rolling her eyes at Sherri and it was hysterical. </p>
<p>Then  Barbara got serious and started calling Suleman on her bullsh*t. </p>
<blockquote><p><B>Again how she&#8217;s going to make money</B><br />
Walters: Excuse me, you didn&#8217;t answer my question. Right now you&#8217;re selling your story. Videos&#8230; how are you planning in the future to take care of 14 children?<br />
Suleman: Every hour, every single hour of the day I contemplate how I&#8217;m going to do this to be able to to support them. It&#8217;s a double edged sword, it&#8217;s a catch 22. If I go back to school&#8230; I have one more year left for my masters&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t possibly earn enough money to take care of them for a couple months. So the only other option is to delve into other opportunities. Secure selective opportunities such as the past, was being in the midst of survival mode, doing interviews, which I didn&#8217;t want to do&#8230; </p>
<p>Walters: Did you think about this before you had the children?<br />
Suleman: Absolutely not. In my mind, I&#8217;m rationalizing, I do that often. I can&#8217;t have kids later. I have this timeframe in regards to fertility&#8230; In my head, delusionally thinking I could finish this, I could have one mroe baby after the six. I could earn enough money as a counselor to take care of them. </p></blockquote>
<p>When Joy asked her about why she had six children (allegedly) implanted, she repeated her same old claim that there were six embryos left and she had to use them and never expected them all to survive. </p>
<p>The best part of the interview came towards the end of the first half. Whoopi asked Suleman if she was all there. </p>
<blockquote><p><B>Whoopi asks Suleman if she&#8217;s &#8220;all there&#8221;</B><br />
Whoopi: You have 14 children. You&#8217;re a single woman who does not to the rest of the world have a way to support these children. Do you understand that people think that there might also be a mind thing with you that maybe you&#8217;re not quite all there.<br />
Suleman: I&#8217;ve asked myself that for years too. Everyone goes thorugh life with these clouded glasses. I was delusionally thinking I was going to have one more&#8230;If I was genuinely mentally unstable, I would have drowned from the beginning. (From all the stress.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This woman had a master plan that she was going to work the media with these eight babies at once and she&#8217;s doing it. She&#8217;s crazy like a fox. I also think she lost that weight through Adderall as that would explain why she was so damn manic. Joy asked her if she was on something and she said &#8220;My mom&#8217;s in her 70s and she has just as much energy as I do.&#8221; [laughing maniacally] Toward the end she was really babbling and laughing like a crazy person. She seriously sounded like the Joker. At the end they asked her if she&#8217;s going to have more kids someday, and Suleman said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to say 100% no.&#8221; </p>

Can you believe it&#8217;s been a whole year since Octomom had the record-setting number of babies and then told Ann Curry that she:<br />
- could afford her kids despite<a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35923/octuplet_mom_nadya_suleman_denies_obsession_with_angelina_jolie/"> having declared bankruptcy and being over $50,00 in debt</a><br />
- never had plastic surgery despite <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35139/video_of_octuplet_mom_interview_she_had_lip_injections_nose_job/">sporting painfully swollen lips</a> and <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35708/octuplet_mom_nadya_suleman_before_plastic_surgery_gets_food_stamps_child_disability/">a new nose</a><br />
- was never on &#8220;welfare&#8221; despite using food stamps and disability for three out of six of her older children and personally <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35051/octuplets_mom_gets_out_of_hospital_and_on_tv_got_over_165k_in_disability/">receiving over $165,000 in disability</a> for a &#8220;bad back&#8221;?</p>
<p>Nadya Suleman has now topped off a year selling videos of herself, in part:<br />
- <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/38145/taped_argument_between_octomom_nadya_suleman_and_her_mother/">arguing with her mother</a><br />
- chatting with a friend <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/54145/nadya_suleman_says_the_father_of_her_kids_would_have_met_them_if_she_hadnt_gotten_pregnant_again/">about the poor fool who lent her the sperm</a> for her baby spree<br />

- <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/48361/octomom_gets_a_tattoo_for_all_her_kids_-_just_like_angelina/">getting a tattoo</a> featuring herself as an angel surrounded by baby &#8220;stars&#8221;<br />
- claiming she&#8217;s <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/54681/nadya_suleman_ive_never_done_anything_wrong_in_my_life_ever/">never done anything wrong - ever</a></p>
<p>By getting paid for the ultimate in home videos - the one featuring<a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/01/exclusive-video-octo-moms-home-video-inside-delivery-room"> her getting all eight babies cut out of her at once</a>! The footage is <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/01/exclusive-video-octo-moms-home-video-inside-delivery-room">featured on Radar Online</a>, and thank Heaven it&#8217;s not as graphic as it could be. It mostly features the babies being shown and includes some footage of duck face attempting to emote for the camera during her groundbreaking c-section. There are some vaguely bloody/graphic sections, and the babies are of course bloody. There are so many doctors surrounding the operating table that you can&#8217;t see much though. The best part is when the person filming gets told off by someone for blocking the way, who then blocks the camera with her hand. (That&#8217;s around 1:40 in, she gets to continue to film though.)</p>
<p>In their coverage, Radar repeats Suleman&#8217;s claim that she only thought she was pregnant with seven babies when an eighth one emerged. That could be true, but Suleman&#8217;s ex publicist recently revealed that his client <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/88881/octomom_had_11_embryos_implanted_to_get_rich_famous_ex_publicist_claims/">had a whopping 11 embryos implanted</a>, not six as she claimed,  in an attempt to get rich and famous. It seems to have worked for her, as she was just featured on the cover of <i>Star</i> showing off her &#8220;bikini body&#8221; which she claims wasn&#8217;t at all assisted by surgery. Just like she&#8217;s never had a nose job, never lived off public assistance, and had no clue she would have a record setting number of babies. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/01/26/2010-01-26_octomom_nadya_suleman_celebrates_octuplets_first_birthday_and_her_own_slimmed_do.html">NY Daily News has a photo of Octomom looking smug</a> while posing around a table with all eight of her babies. The table is set with a cake, the octuplets are all wearing cute birthday hats, and there are balloons and a happy birthday sign in the background. Since today is their official birthday, we can assume the birthday scene was photographed at least a day in advance of their real birthday. </p>

Yesterday we saw <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/88770/star_octo-mom_insists_her_bikini_body_isnt_the_result_of_surgery/">some disturbing bikini photos of Octomom Nadya Suleman</a>, who has apparently been exercising and dieting while other people take care of her 14 children. Suleman has also had some obvious help from a plastic surgeon, although she denied using surgical intervention, saying &#8220;No way, I would feel like I cheated.&#8221; As many of you pointed out, Suleman&#8217;s belly button is elongated, which is a clear sign of a tummy tuck. This woman similary <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35139/video_of_octuplet_mom_interview_she_had_lip_injections_nose_job/">denied ever being on welfare</a> despite using food stamps and disability payments for herself and three out of six of her older children. She also denied having any plastic surgery prior to her latest transformation although <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/35708/octuplet_mom_nadya_suleman_before_plastic_surgery_gets_food_stamps_child_disability/">when you see what she looked like</a> before it&#8217;s obvious that her nose, lips and eyes have been remolded. </p>
<p>The latest news about Suleman&#8217;s lies comes from <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/40362/octuplet_mothers_pr_rep_says_the_woman_is_nuts/">her ex publicist, Victor Munoz</a>. Munoz says that Suleman had a whopping 11 embryos implanted which resulted in the octuplet birth, not just 6 which split as she claims. He told the <em>National Enquirer</em> that Suleman made a mad dash to her fertility doctor to destroy the evidence. He also confirmed the suspicion that she planned all along to get pregnant with a record breaking number of multiples in order to cash in: </p>
<blockquote><p>Octo-Mom Nadya Suleman desperately tried to cover up the fact that she had 11 embryos implanted - rather than the six she has claimed with two resulting in twins - and even said she had her medical records shredded to hide the evidence, according to her former publicist.</p>
<p>When news broke that her fertility specialist, Dr. Michael Kamrava, could lose his license over the sensational birth of her eight babies, Nadya - who lives with her 14 children in La Habra, Calif. - denied he&#8217;d done anything wrong. </p>
<p>But former publicist, Victor Munoz, has exclusively revealed to The ENQUIRER that the 34-year-old single mother was &#8220;terrified&#8221; she&#8217;d lose out on lucrative book deals, documentaries and TV opportunities if the truth came out. </p>
<p>Munoz says Nadya called him to her home last February, shortly after the octuplets&#8217; headline-making birth on Jan. 26, 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was very upset and nervous,&#8221; revealed Munoz. &#8220;She told me, &#8216;You&#8217;ve got to take me over to Dr. Kamrava&#8217;s so we can get rid of the paperwork on the octuplets. We&#8217;re in enough trouble over the news that he did six transfers at once. If it comes out that I actually had 11, it will destroy my image.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nadya was particularly worried that Dr. Kamrava had her sign a waiver acknowledging it was dangerous to implant that many embryos at one time. She didn&#8217;t want it to be revealed that she had deliberately put herself through a very dangerous procedure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Munoz says Nadya told him a few days later that everything was &#8220;taken care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I got the doctor&#8217;s nurse to shred the records. That evidence is gone,&#8217; she told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nadya&#8217;s plan was always to make money out of her amazing pregnancy. So she was terrified that people would find out the crazy risk she took just to become famous.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> [From The <a href="http://web.nationalenquirer.com/ocotomom_suleman_coverup_11_embryos_implanted/celebrity/67984">National Enquirer</a>]</p>
<p>Suleman is the worst kind of delusional leech on society. She&#8217;s just smart enough to play the system to meet her needs and she knows enough about fame to get paid over and over again for her story. Now she&#8217;s lost weight and is working the &#8220;bikini body&#8221; angle with the cover of <i>Star</i> Magazine. I hope that her doctor loses his license and that she&#8217;s forced to pay back the over a million dollars worth of free medical care she received from the state of California. </p>

<p>If you’re not already dry-heaving, can I just say that I think Nadya “Octo-Mom” Suleman had her boobs done?  I mean, in addition to all of the other crap she’s had done to her face and body, I think she got her boobs lifted or something.  Because there is no way her boobs look like that naturally.  Oh, but wait!  In the interview with <em>Star Magazine</em>, Nadya “insists” that there was no plastic surgery involved.  She says she would feel like she “cheated” if she had gone under the knife. And if you believe that&#8230;. </p>
<blockquote><p>Wow — just look at her now!</p>
<p>Octomom Nadya Suleman — down to 120 lbs., from a whopping 270 — dares to bare in a stunning new photo shoot, published exclusively in this week&#8217;s Star.</p>
<p>The mom-of-14 flaunts her new body just a year after her record-breaking delivery in a stunning set of bikini photos.</p>
<p>Nadya shows what exercise and good diet can do in an eight-page special in the magazine, which hits newsstands today. And she insists there was no help from any plastic surgery.</p>
<p>&#8220;No way, I would feel like I cheated,&#8221; she tells Star. &#8220;I wanted to prove to myself that I can do it on my own, naturally. My friends call me Rubber Band because I always snapped back so quickly after my other kids!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nadya, who lives in La Habra, Calif. became the first woman in the world to give birth to eight healthy children when she had a Caesarian section in January last year. She has six other children ranging in age from 7 to 3.</p>
<p>Star has exclusive photos of the 34-year-old frolicking on a California beach, exercising and spending time with her octuplets — six boys and two girls — who celebrate their birthday Jan. 26. And in a world exclusive interview, she talks about her personal life as well as details about what she eats and how she works out to maintain her newly-trim figure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seriously, how f-cking delusional is this woman?  Oh, yes, her body looks like that after having 14 babies… naturally!  And why is she (and the media) concentrating on her “bikini body”?  Doesn’t this woman have a million babies to look after?  I thought she wanted everyone to leave her alone…?  Or did I hallucinate that?  Oh, and <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/53965/nadya_suleman_tears_up_kate_gosselin_bikini_pics_calls_her_body_boxy/">CB remembered this</a>: Nadya once criticised Kate Gosselin&#8217;s bikini pics, saying &#8220;I’m not as attention seeking. [I'll] Probably never [wear a bikini], and if I do I’ll be more appropriate I’ll wear little boy shorts like the 50s or 60s bikinis. A little cuter less attention seeking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor who implanted Octomom Nadya Suleman with eight embryos and who worked with her from the age of 21 has been accused of &#8220;gross negligence&#8221; by the California Medical Board. Doctor Michael Kamrava has been issued a stern disciplinary warning for multiple counts of negligence relating to his treatment of Suleman. His license has not been suspended yet and he is allowed to continue to practice pending a hearing. In response to learning about her doctor potentially losing his license, single mom of 14 <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/01/exclusive-video-interview-octo-mom-nadya-suleman-defends-octo-doc-accused-gross">Suleman immediately said</a> &#8220;What am I going to do if I ever want to go back?&#8221; I wish I was kidding. </p>
<blockquote><p>Nadya Suleman&#8217;s fertility specialist could lose his medical license over allegations by the California Medical Board that he transferred too many embryos into the woman who went on to give birth to octuplets. </p>
<p>A 13-page accusation filed in December says that over 11 years Suleman returned to Dr. Michael Kamrava&#8217;s office repeatedly. The number of embryos Kamrava transferred in July 2008 was so abnormal they &#8220;should not be transferred into any woman, regardless of age&#8221; and the transfers went &#8220;beyond the reasonable judgment of any treating physician.&#8221; </p>
<p>The papers suggest Suleman&#8217;s actions put her current and future children at risk, and Kamrava should have sent Suleman to therapy instead of obliging her extreme maternal cravings. Suleman had six other children and was receiving public assistance. </p>
<p>The allegations will be litigated in administrative court. The Beverly Hills doctor also recently was expelled from a national organization that promotes ethical standards in reproductive medicine.</p>
<p>Kamrava&#8217;s attorney, Peter Osinoff, tells PEOPLE that his client is &#8220;devastated,&#8221; and that he was only obliging his patient&#8217;s requests and not breaking any laws. </p>
<p>Osinoff says no hearing has yet been scheduled on the matter, and likely won&#8217;t be scheduled for about five months. In the meantime, Kamrava continues to practice.</p></blockquote>
<p> [From <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20334668,00.html">People</a>]</p>
<p>The disciplinary accusation against Kamrava is available <a href="http://www.latimes.com/includes/misc/kamravaaccusation.pdf">as a PDF on the LATimes&#8217; website</a>.  I read through it and while I don&#8217;t understand all of it the gist is that Kamrava never questioned Suleman about her decision to have so many kids as a single mom, he never informed her properly of the risks as far as the board is aware, and he neglected to have her referred for a mental health evaluation when it was clear there was something wrong with her. Suleman would return to him for an IVF treatment every four months after having her last child. Kamrava also gave her too many successive ovarian stimulation treatments instead of using existing embryos that were created from her other rounds of IVF. Then he of course implanted her with the whopping eight embryos (or maybe it was six as she claimed and some more grew or split) when the maximum number recommended for her age is two at a time. </p>
<p>Suleman has not ruled out having more children. She said in an interview with Good Morning America last month that she might be open to adding to her over dozen brood. &#8220;<em>If I wanted to do it the traditional way and get married. That’s like another chapter</em>.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope that she won&#8217;t be able to find a doctor willing to help her or a husband willing to take on that level of crazy. </p>

                    <p><center><img src="http://www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/12.jpg" alt="12" title="12" width="511" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82140" /></center></p>
<p>Octomom Nadya Suleman says she might have more kids one day.  Well, first she said she wouldn’t talk about it, and then she kept talking.  And eventually said yes, she’d consider it.  She said it with the caveat that it would have to be if she ever got married and started a new chapter in her life.  I think that was supposed to be some sort of reassurance to the rest of us that she doesn’t have any embryos tucked away in the back of her freezer next to a hardened bag of peas.  I hope.  </p>
<p>“Good Morning America” did a seven minute piece on Nadya and the octuplets this morning, and I was all prepared to be angry at her and hate her.  Unfortunately they showed waaaaay too much footage of adorable big-eyed babies, so I’m all squishy right now.  I’m trying to get myself back to that angry place so I can write this properly.  </p>
<p>The segments starts off by showing clips from Octomom’s upcoming documentary - with one of the older kids (we don’t see who it is) throwing a <em>screwdriver </em>at Nadya.  It hits her hard in the face.  Instead of punishing the child properly, she just whines and complains, then a bit later yells, “You threw it at my face! You don’t do that!”  And she says it in the same voice as a complaining 5-year-old.  Not exactly a powerful repercussion there.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Octo-Mom Nadya Suleman said she might have more children someday, as Good Morning America caught up with the mother-of-14 at her La Habra, California home on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wanted to do it the traditional way and get married,&#8221; she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s like another chapter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suleman, looking slim, said she&#8217;s reliant on projects with various media outlets to support her large family, though she &#8220;tries to limit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m damned if I do and damned if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, adding that her monthly help expenses &#8212; which include four people assisting her on a daily basis &#8212; add up to more than $10,000.</p>
<p>She said raising her children is a &#8220;day-by-day, hour-by-hour&#8221; task.</p>
<p>According to Suleman, she said she doesn&#8217;t regret having all of her children, contradicting previous statements she made right here on RadarOnline.com. When asked if she had contemplated putting any of the children up for adoption, Suleman said &#8220;that&#8217;s not appropriate for me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>[From <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2009/11/video-14-and-counting-octo-mom-nadya-suleman-open-having-more-kids">Radar</a>] </p>
<p>At one point GMA shows footage from the documentary where someone asks Nadya if she regretted having all the children, noting, “Nadya stands by her decision to carry all the octuplets to term.”  Then they show Nadya playing at the park with her kids, and she says, “No, because, which one should I have murdered? Noah… Isaiah… Jonah? That’s why.”  She does a good job throughout of answering, “That wasn’t an appropriate decision for me,” when questioned about adoption or donating her unused embryos.  That probably would have been a better answer to the selective reduction question.  </p>
<p>Octomom still drives me nuts, and watching her interact with her older kids – and the discipline issues – really worries me for the younger ones.  Nonetheless, I will be absolutely glued to the TV when they air her special in December.  </p>
