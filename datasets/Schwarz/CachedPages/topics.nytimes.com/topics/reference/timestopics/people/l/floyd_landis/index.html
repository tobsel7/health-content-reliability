He was a former Mennonite, a nice guy with a quick wit and a relaxed nature. He was the underdog with a bad hip.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Landis fell quickly and hard into his own nightmare, which cost him his reputation, his career and more than $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Landis was stripped of his title more than a year after winning the 2006 Tour when an arbitrators' 2-to-1 decision supported initial findings that Landis had synthetic testosterone in his urine during the race.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In May 2010, after years of maintaining his innocence about doping charges Landis sent e-mail messages to several cycling officials in the United States and in Europe in which he admitted using performance-enhancing drugs for most of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Officials said that Landis's messages provided a detailed description of doping that began in 2002, Landis's first year alongside then-teammate &lt;a title=More articles about Lance Armstrong. href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/lance_armstrong/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Lance Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;.

Other cyclists named were current United States road racing national champion George Hincapie, three-time Tour of California champion Levi Leipheimer and five-time United States time trial champion David Zabriskie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Landis provided detailed information about his own doping practices, saying he consistently used the blood-booster EPO to increase his endurance, testosterone, human growth hormone and blood transfusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He said he took female hormones and tried insulin once during the years he rode for the Postal Service and Swiss-based Phonak teams, according to ESPN.com. He spent $90,000 a year on his doping regimen, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Landis is embroiled in a separate legal issue in France, where a &lt;a title=New York Times article href=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/sports/cycling/16landis.html&gt;warrant was issued&lt;/a&gt; for his arrest, in April 2010, for suspicion of involvement in a data hacking case that occurred in the fall of 2006 at the Châtenay-Malabry antidoping lab, which conducted the tests on Landis's urine samples from the 2006 Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Landis became the first champion in the history of the race to lose the title because of a doping offense and was barred from the sport for two years, retroactive to Jan. 30, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The doping scandal surrounding Landis is only one of many that have hovered over cycling for years.

<p><span class="timestamp">Updated: May 20, 2010</span></p>
<p>When he won the 2006 Tour de France, Floyd Landis was supposed to be the man who would deliver cycling from its past doping scandals. He was a former Mennonite, a nice guy with a quick wit and a relaxed nature. He was the underdog with a bad hip.</p>
<p>Instead, Landis fell quickly and hard into his own nightmare, which cost him his reputation, his career and more than $2 million.</p>
<p>Landis was stripped of his title more than a year after winning the 2006 Tour when an arbitrators' 2-to-1 decision supported initial findings that Landis had synthetic testosterone in his urine during the race.</p>
<p>In May 2010, after years of maintaining his innocence about doping charges Landis sent e-mail messages to several cycling officials in the United States and in Europe in which he admitted using performance-enhancing drugs for most of his career.</p>
<p>Officials said that Landis's messages provided a detailed description of doping that began in 2002, Landis's first year alongside then-teammate <a title="More articles about Lance Armstrong." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/lance_armstrong/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Lance Armstrong</a>. Both were riding for the successful but now-defunct United States Postal Service team.</p>
<p class="showhidetxt"><a id="more" title="More" href="javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');">Read More...</a></p>
<div id="moretxt">
<p>In the messages Landis accused other top American cyclists on the Postal Service team, including Armstrong, of using performance-enhancing drugs and methods. Other cyclists named were current United States road racing national champion George Hincapie, three-time Tour of California champion Levi Leipheimer and five-time United States time trial champion David Zabriskie.</p>
<p>Landis provided detailed information about his own doping practices, saying he consistently used the blood-booster EPO to increase his endurance, testosterone, human growth hormone and blood transfusions.</p>
<p>He said he took female hormones and tried insulin once during the years he rode for the Postal Service and Swiss-based Phonak teams, according to ESPN.com. He spent $90,000 a year on his doping regimen, he said.</p>
<p>Landis is embroiled in a separate legal issue in France, where a <a title="New York Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/sports/cycling/16landis.html">warrant was issued</a> for his arrest, in April 2010, for suspicion of involvement in a data hacking case that occurred in the fall of 2006 at the Châtenay-Malabry antidoping lab, which conducted the tests on Landis's urine samples from the 2006 Tour.</p>
<p>Landis became the first champion in the history of the race to lose the title because of a doping offense and was barred from the sport for two years, retroactive to Jan. 30, 2007.</p>
<p>The doping scandal surrounding Landis is only one of many that have hovered over cycling for years. Before the 2006 Tour, several top riders were barred from the race for being implicated in a doping ring in Spain.</p>
