      <h2><a name="message"></a>A Message from the Secretary</h2>
      <p>Dear Investor:<br>
      </p>
      <p>There are a number of investment options available to you as a consumer. 
        Many people have chosen mutual funds as their primary means of investing. 
        Mutual funds provide professional management, diversification, convenience 
        and liquidity. As with all investments, mutual funds are not risk free. 
        It is essential that you make an informed investment decision and choose 
        a mutual fund which is right for you depending on your goals, investment 
        time frame and risk tolerance.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many questions can arise when it comes to mutual fund investing. What 
        is a mutual fund? What are the different types of mutual funds? How do 
        I choose a fund that is right for me? What are the risks? This pamphlet 
        is designed to help answer these basic questions. If you have any questions 
        or need further assistance, please contact my office at 617-727-3548. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
      </p>

      <h2><br>
        <a name="tips"></a>Mutual Fund Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine your investment objectives. What is your invest ment goal: 
          preserving principal; generating income; paying for a child's education; 
          or saving for retirement? Choose a mutual fund whose objective is in 
          line with that goal. </li>
        <li>Thoroughly understand the risks associated with the mutual fund you 
          are considering and be sure that you are comfort able taking on those 
          risks. </li>
        <li>Read and understand all information in the fund's prospectus, Statement 
          of Additional Information, and, if available, its annual report. Call 
          the fund company or the Securities Division if you have questions regarding 
          these materials. </li>
        <li>Take the time to study the fund's fee table. Compare the fees among 
          various fund groups before choosing a fund. These fees are expenses 
          of the fund and will significantly affect your returns. </li>
        <li>Depending on your own investing experience, decide whether you should 
          invest in a fund directly or through a broker -dealer. A broker-dealer 
          can provide investment advice but will charge a sales load. In some 
          funds you can invest directly without the assistance of a broker-dealer. 
          These funds do not charge a sales load but do not give investment advice. 
        </li>
        <li>If you are investing through a broker-dealer or utilizing the services 
          of a financial advisor, contact the Securities Divi sion to see if your 
          broker or financial advisor is registered in Massachusetts or has any 
          past disciplinary matters on file. </li>
        <li>If you are investing in a mutual fund sold at your bank or credit 
          union, make sure you understand that the fund is not an insured deposit 
          and that it is not guaranteed by the financial institution, the FDIC 
          or any other federal agency. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><br>
        <a name="what"></a>What Is a Mutual Fund?</h2>
      <p>A mutual fund, also called an investment company, is an investment vehicle 
        which pools the money of many investors. The fund's manager uses the money 
        collected to purchase securities such as stocks and bonds. The securities 
        purchased are referred to as the fund's portfolio. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When you give your money to a mutual fund, you receive shares of the 
        fund in return. Each share represents an interest in the fund's portfolio. 
        The value of your mutual fund shares will rise and fall depending upon 
        the performance of the securi ties in the portfolio. Like a shareholder 
        in a corporation, you will receive a proportional share of income and 
        interest gener ated by the portfolio. You can receive these distributions 
        either in cash or as additional shares of the fund. As a shareholder, 
        you also have certain shareholder voting rights. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A mutual fund's portfolio is managed by a professional money manager. 
        The manager's business is to choose securities which are best suited for 
        the portfolio. Be aware, however, that even a profes sional money manager 
        cannot insure against a loss of principal. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The mutual fund manager will invest in many different securities. This 
        diversification of portfolio assets means that you as an investor have 
        not pinned all your hopes on one company's success. Also, because the 
        portfolio holds many securities, the negative impact that any one company 
        may have on the fund is diminished. While diversification is a benefit 
        of mutual fund investing, a mutual fund is still impacted, either favorably 
        or unfavorably, by the ups and downs of the market in general. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Mutual funds provide a relatively easy way to invest. Most funds have 
        a minimum investment of $1000. In addition, a mutual fund stands ready 
        to buy back, or redeem, your shares at any time. This liquidity allows 
        you to get your money when needed. There is no guarantee, however, that 
        your shares at the time of redemption will not have decreased in value. 
      </p>
      <p><a href="#Top">Top of page</a> </p>
      <h2><br>
        <a name="types"></a>Types of Mutual Funds</h2>
      <p>The types of mutual funds vary according to the fund's investment objective. 
        A fund's investment objective will usually seek capital gains (gains from 
        the sale of portfolio securities), income (interest and dividends earned 
        on the portfolio securi ties) or a combination of both. While not a comprehensive 
        list of all mutual funds, the basic types of funds are described below. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Money Market:</b> A money market fund seeks safety of principal by 
        investing in high quality, short-term securities. This type of fund is 
        designed with the aim that an investor's principal should not decrease 
        in value. There is no guarantee, how ever, that this will always be the 
        case. A money market fund seeks to provide a regular distribution of income 
        which is determined by short-term interest rates. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Growth:</b> A growth fund invests primarily in the common stock of 
        well established companies. This type of fund may invest for long-term 
        capital gains and is not intended for an investor who seeks income. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Aggressive Growth:</b> Like a growth fund, an aggressive growth fund 
        will invest primarily in common stock for long-term capital gains. An 
        aggressive growth fund may invest in the common stock of small companies, 
        out-of-favor companies or companies in new industries. It, therefore, 
        has a higher degree of risk than a basic growth fund. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Income:</b> An income fund invests in either corporate, govern ment, 
        or municipal debt securities. A debt security is an obligation which pays 
        interest on a regular basis. Hence, this type of fund is designed for 
        investors who desire periodic income payments. There are, however, substantial 
        differ ences and varying degrees of risk among income funds depending 
        on the credit quality of the debt issuer, the maturity of the debt instrument, 
        and prevailing interest rates. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>High Income:</b> This category of income fund seeks to achieve a high 
        degree of income by investing a material portion of its portfolio in below 
        investment grade debt securities or junk bonds. These funds have a high 
        degree of risk and should be purchased by investors who can incur the 
        risk of loss of principal. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Balanced:</b> A balanced fund, as the name implies, invests for both 
        growth and income. The fund will invest in both equity and debt securities. 
        A balanced fund seeks to provide long-term growth through its equity component 
        as well as income to be generated by the portfolio's debt securities. 
      </p>
      <p><a href="#Top">Top of page</a></p>
      <h2><br>
        <a name="risk"></a>Balancing Risk with Investment Goals</h2>
      <p>Do not let anyone tell you that mutual funds are free from risk. While 
        risks vary depending on the fund, the potential danger is the same - loss 
        of principal and income. You must determine your own risk tolerance level. 
        This determination should be made with your investment goals in mind. 
        Risks that may be acceptable for a long-term investor seeking capital 
        appreciation may not be suitable for an investor seeking income and principal 
        protection. The following chart is intended to provide you with a starting 
        point for matching mutual fund objectives with your risk tolerance. Be 
        aware that not every fund designed to meet one of the stated objectives 
        will have a similar degree of risk. You should refer to the fund's prospectus 
        to determine the risks associated with a fund. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Fund Objective/Degree of Risk <br>
        Money Market/Low <br>
        Growth/Medium to High <br>
        Aggressive Growth/High <br>

      <h2><br>
        <a name="disclose"></a>Disclosure Documents</h2>
      <h3>The Prospectus <br>
      </h3>
      <p>The fund's prospectus is one of the most important docu ments to read 
        when purchasing a mutual fund. It supplies the material information you 
        will need to make an informed invest ment decision. Information is also 
        available in the prospectus on certain administrative aspects of the fund, 
        such as buying, redeeming and exchanging shares. </p>
      <h3>The Statement of Additional Information <br>
      </h3>
      <p>The SAI includes information which supplements what is disclosed in the 
        prospectus. A fund's audited financial statement and a list of its portfolio 
        holdings are included in the SAI, as well as in the annual report (see 
        below). Because the SAI has been legally incorporated into the prospectus, 
        it will be assumed that you have read it. Hence, you should always ask 
        for a copy and read the SAI before investing in a mutual fund. If you 
        encounter any problems when requesting this document, please contact the 
        Securities Division. </p>
      <h3>The Annual Report <br>
      </h3>
      <p>The annual report is forwarded to a fund's shareholders at the end of 
        each fiscal year. It includes the fund's audited financial statements 
        and a list of the fund's portfolio securities. Unless otherwise included 
        in the prospectus, a fund will include in its annual report a line graph 
        comparing its performance to that of an appropriate broad-based securities 
        market index, as well as a discussion of those events, strategies and 
        techniques which affected its performance during the past fiscal year. 
        An annual report includes material information which may not be available 
        in other disclosure documents and, if available, should be read by a potential 
        investor. </p>
      <p><a href="#Top">Top of page</a></p>
      <h2><br>
        <a name="charges"></a>Mutual Fund Sales Charges</h2>
      <p>A mutual fund which sells its shares directly to investors without paying 
        sales commissions to broker-dealers is referred to as a no-load fund. 
        When you invest in a no-load fund your entire investment goes into buying 
        shares of the fund. However, because you are not paying a commission to 
        a broker-dealer, you will not receive financial advice. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When financial advice is needed, some investors choose a load fund. A 
        load fund pays a broker-dealer a sales commission. The amount you invest 
        in the fund is decreased by the payment of the sales commission. Some 
        load funds, rather than charging the sales commission at the time of the 
        sale, charge the fee when money is taken out of the fund. This fee is 
        referred to as a contingent deferred sales charge or a back-end load. 
        The back -end fee will usually decrease to zero the longer an investor 
        remains in the fund. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Another sales-related expense, which is often overlooked by investors, 
        is the 12b-1 fee. This fee, which is disclosed in the fund's fee table, 
        can be used by the fund for marketing, advertis ing or sales commissions. 
        Because the 12b-1 fee is a charge against the fund on an annual basis, 
        an investor could over the long term pay more in 12b-1 fees than would 
        have been permis sible as a maximum front end sales load. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Many load funds offer investors the option of paying the sales load up-front, 
        back-end or a combination of a reduced sales commission and a 12b-1 fee. 
        These sales-related options are called classes of fund shares. You should 
        choose the class that best matches your needs and investment time frame.</p>
