				 is simply the process of taking out a new mortgage to pay off your existing 
				 loan. When refinancing	your mortgage it helps to understand 
				 the market and how home mortgages work to avoid overpaying for your 
				 new loan. The mortgage industry in the United States is comprised of two parts 
				called markets. The primary or 
				retail markets sells home loans to consumers, and the 
				secondary mortgage market buys and sells mortgage debt as an 
				investment vehicle. An example of a secondary market institution 
				is the government backed, for-profit organization Freddie Mac. Mortgage refinancing takes place in the 
				primary or retail market and is the topic of this article.</p>

				Information</font></h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px" align="justify">
				<font face="Georgia" size="2">The first thing you should do before 
				shopping for a new loan is brush 
				up on your mortgage terminology and how the process works. A good mortgage
				guidebook will have you speaking the lingo like you know exactly what you’re doing. This is 
				helpful because if your mortgage retailer thinks you know what 
				you’re doing (even if you don’t) they will be less like to try 
				and take advantage of you. Just like a car salesman, mortgage 
				refinancing companies and brokers prey on uninformed 
				homeowners. Doing 
				your homework and carefully shopping for the best 
				mortgage refinancing loan will help you avoid costly mistakes 
				that prevent the majority of homeowners from realizing the benefits of <b>Mortgage 
				Refinancing.</b></font></p>
				<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px" align="justify">
				<font face="Georgia" size="2">Mortgage refinancing is just like purchasing a kitchen 
				appliance. If you approach mortgage refinancing like shopping 
				for a dishwasher, you will save yourself thousands of dollars 
				and many future headaches. Mortgage refinancing loans are 
				commodities, and just like a dishwasher or toaster oven, they are only worth 
				what someone is willing to pay for them. Understanding the 
				retail mortgage refinancing market is the first step to avoiding 
				costly homeowner mistakes. The retail mortgage refinancing 
				marketplace is composed of retailers consisting of mortgage 
				companies, mortgage brokers, banks, and broker-banks. Mortgage 
				refinancing should never be done with a bank. Broker-banks are 
				simply banks pretending to be mortgage brokers and should also 
				be avoided.&nbsp; The reason for avoiding banks and broker banks 
				is that these lenders are exempt from disclosure laws that 
				protect homeowners in the United States from predatory lending 
				practices.&nbsp; </font></p></font>
				<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px">
				<font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Mortgage Refinancing</b> retailers 
				sell mortgage products for wholesale lenders. These 
				mortgage companies and brokers, whether online or brick and 
				mortar, simply pass quotes from a wholesale lender on to the 
				consumer. What you might not know about these mortgage 
				refinancing quotes is that the retail mortgage company or broker 
				always inflates the interest rate quoted by the wholesale 
				lender. The retail company cleverly disguises their markup in 
				the loan documents, overcharging unwary homeowners. This markup 
				is called “Yield Spread Premium” and is where the majority of 
				the mortgage refinancing profits originates. How does the 
				mortgage refinancing Yield Spread work?</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px" align="justify">Suppose you visit George the 
				Mortgage Broker. George gives you a mortgage refinancing quote of 6.75%. 
				This seems like a good interest rate and you sign the <b>Mortgage Refinancing</b> 
				contract. What you don’t know is that the wholesale mortgage refinancing 
				lender qualified you for 6.25% and George marked the interest rate up 
				to 6.75% on the quote he gave you. The additional .5% is the 
				Yield Spread Premium you overpaid for the loan. Why do mortgage 
				brokers do this? They receive compensation for their services 
				with the origination fee you pay; this is clearly documented in 
				your contract. What isn’t so clear is the inflated interest rate 
				that the broker is quoting and the additional bonus received from the 
				wholesale mortgage refinancing lender.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px" align="justify">
				That’s right; George receives a bonus of one point for every 
				.25% he 
				scams you with your mortgage refinancing. The wholesale mortgage 
				refinancing lender gives this bonus (1 point = 1% of your loan 
				amount) as an incentive to overcharge you for mortgage 
				refinancing. If your mortgage was for $250,000, George will 
				receive a tidy bonus of $5,000 for ripping you off and you will 
				never know it. This is how Yield Spread Premium works and how 
				every mortgage company and mortgage refinancing broker operates. 
				Not only does the retail mortgage refinancing company pocket your origination fees, the wholesale lender rewards them 
				for overcharging you. <br>
				<br>
				How can you avoid paying Yield Spread Premium when shopping 
				for a <i>mortgage refinancing</i> loan? Homeowners that know 
				what to look for can easily spot Yield Spread Premium on the 
				mortgage refinancing Good Faith Estimate and Hud-1 statement. You 
				can learn how to recognize Yield Spread Premium when mortgage 
				refinancing along with other strategies to comparison shop for the 
				most competitive loan offers by registering for our free
