<p>The appeasement will charge on full-speed ahead. And meanwhile, although many American analysts are making a great deal of the unrest that has followed the voting, in reality the pro-Mousavi sentiment is not quite the encouraging sign that so many wish it would be, and assume that it is. As <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2009/06/its-always-been-the-mullahs-.html" target="_blank">Pamela</a> points out, Mousavi was a founder of Hizballah and participated in the creation of Iran's intelligence service.

<p>There was palpable disappointment within the administration, where there were hopes, as President Obama said Friday, that the throngs of people at the polls augured a change in Iran.</p>

<p>Trying to put a positive face on the outcome, one senior administration official held out the hope that the intensity of the political debate during the campaign, and the huge turnout, might make Mr. Ahmadinejad more receptive to the United States, if only to defuse a potential backlash from the disputed election.</p>

<p>“Ahmadinejad could feel that because of public pressure, he wants to reduce Iran’s isolation,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the delicacy of the matter. “That might also cause engagement to proceed more swiftly.”...</blockquote></p>
