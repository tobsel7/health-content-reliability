				<h1>House Passes Carbon Cap-and-Trade Bill</h1>
				<p class="postedBy">Posted by: Dan Beucke on June 26</p>
		
				<p>By John Carey</p>

<p>June 26, 2009, will go down as an historic moment in world’s efforts to tackle climate change. For the first time, a Congressional body passed legislation that would place mandatory limits on the emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. By the barest margin of 219 to 212, the House of Representatives voted for a bill spearheaded by Representatives Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Edward Markey (D-Mass.). If it becomes law, the measure would require a massive switch to cleaner sources of energy over the next four decades. “This is the landmark energy and environmental legislative achievement of a generation,” says Phyllis Cuttino, director of the Pew Environment Group’s U.S. Global Warming Campaign.</p>
				
				<p>The legislation itself is enormous. It’s more than a thousand pages long, filled with obscure provisions that will keep an army of lobbyists employed for years. It’s been resoundingly panned both by groups on the left, such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, who see it as an enormous corporate giveaway, and by Republicans, who accuse it of being a massive tax that will hobble the U.S. economy. It even was attacked by the powerful farm lobby, despite a cornucopia of goodies added in the last few days to get their champion, House Agriculture Chairman Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.), on board.</p>

<p>What’s more, the bill lies at the center of a high-stakes political calculation by the GOP. While there’s a strong anti-regulation ideology in the Republican Party, there have been plenty of Republicans who urged passage of climate legislation. Such supporters included governors like California’s Arnold Schwarzenegger and Florida’s Charlie Crist, along with Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). But those former advocates have gone silent. The party has decided its best strategy for getting back into power is to deny President Barack Obama, who strongly backed the bill, any victories, no matter what the issue. At the same time, the GOP wants to paint the Democrats as the party of new taxes. </p>

<p>Of course, this Republican plan could backfire. Polls show the public supports action on climate, studies from the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency show the costs of the legislation would be modest. Eight Republicans voted for the bill.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to powerful forces that were working against the legislation. So why did it pass? Why did major environmental organizations, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund, and scores of companies, from General Electric and Shell to utilities like Exelon and Pacific Gas & Electric, pull out all the stops to push it through?</p>

<p>Part of the answer is simple. Many in industry have come to believe that, given what science is learning, the costs of inaction are far greater than the price tag of the legislation. “We need to get started,” says J. Wayne Leonard, CEO of Entergy, a New Orleans-based utility. “The idea of moving this problem to our children just doesn’t work for us.” Yes, energy prices will rise, adds Ralph Izzo, CEO of PSEG Energy in Newark, N.J.,  “but the world we will leave our kids is a lot better than the world we would otherwise leave.”</p>

<p>Plus, companies figure that curbs on greenhouse gas emissions are inevitable, anyway. Better to get the rules now so that they know what kinds of powerplants or cars to build—and where find new business opportunities. For instance, whoever figures out the best technology for capturing carbon dioxide from smokestacks “will make a ton of money on it,” says William L. Sigmon, senior vice president for engineering, projects & field services at American Electric Power in Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>The mere fact that the House passed a bill at all also gives the Obama Administration a stronger hand to play in upcoming international negotiations. There’s no solution to the global climate problem unless China and India agree to cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. Those countries won’t sign on until the U.S., which has been the main contributor to the problem, first shows that it’s serious. Getting a bill through the House is a major sign that the country is moving on the issue. </p>

<p>But perhaps the biggest reason why support remained strong enough to win passage, despite the legislation’s many flaws and opponents, is that the measure is actually expected to work. The basic idea is straightforward: The bill sets a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases. By 2020, emissions must be reduced 17% over 2005 levels. By 2050, emissions must be reduced 80% or more. Staying under these caps is done with a system of permits or allowances. Companies must have an allowance for every ton of greenhouse gas they emit. They are allowed to buy and sell those allowances, but gradually the total number of allowances will be reduced, thus reducing overall emissions.</p>

<p>In the week leading up to the vote, industry groups wrangled fiercely over how those allowances are given out. Should be auctioned off or handed out for free? When utilities managed to win 35% of the initial allowances for free, some environmental groups accused the House of orchestrating a massive corporate giveaway. But the “remarkable” quality of a cap and trade system, says Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program, is that all this lobbying really didn’t matter. In some cases the messy political process can doom a policy to failure. It can add enormous efficiencies to a weapons program, for instance (by requiring subcontractors in every district), or completely water down a tax (through loopholes and exemptions). But no matter who wins or loses in the allocation scheme in a cap and trade system, the environmental goal will be reached—and the overall cost to society is the same, says Stavins. “That is the very fortunate property of a cap and trade system. There is this marvelous political safety value.” That’s why the main environmental groups stayed on board, even when individual industries garnered goodies in the bill.</p>

<p>There’s still a long road ahead for the legislation. The Senate isn’t expected to take up the issue until fall at the earliest—and the path to passage there will be tougher. But for now, supporters are savoring their victory. “Today we have taken decisive and historic action to promote America’s energy security and to create millions of clean energy jobs that will drive our economic recovery and long-term growth,” Waxman said. </p>

<p>Adds John W. Rowe, chairman and CEO of Exelon, a Chicago-based utility: “Addressing climate change is one of the most compelling causes of our time, and we applaud the House for taking bold and decisive action to pass this pragmatic and balanced legislation.”</p>

							<p>1. "Climate Change" will happen with or without man, as it has done for thousands of years.<br />
2. The American people do not know what is in this bill, from higher electricity rates to higher natural gas rates to higher taxes on every natural resource.  We simply CANNOT afford this.  It WILL prolong the economic slump.<br />
3. The House does not know what is in this bill, but the Obama administration just wants to rush this along with all the other new taxes ("stimulus, et al") before the people have a chance to realize how bad it all is.<br />
4. Over 7,000 climate scientists have spoken out and signed a petition that states "climate change" is NOT caused by man, more than the number of scientists who wrote the UN charter on the topic.<br />
5. This, along with the "stimulus" and "health care reform" is able to succeed to a degree because the American people are, for the most part, sheep who demand to be led, do not care to be involved in the process, do not care to know what is happening in their government, do not care to act on their own behalf and figure that Obama is more intelligent than they are, when in fact he is leading them down the road to higher taxes, higher inflation, higher costs on all natural resources and all because of a false theory that curtailing carbon emissions can make a difference.</p>

							<p>This is historic only in that we the US public will have HUGE energy bills that will break the back of most Americans.  This is all for a premise, not a truth, that we have Global Warming.  This was pushed by the left and some misguided Republicans who are really not Conservatives such as John McCain and Charles Crist. This is going to bite them both big time along with the left of the Democratic party.  Climate change occurs throughout history and scientists right here in Michigan have attributed it to things like sun spots, the wobble in the Earth's rotation, many various causes.  Climatic climate change occurred PRIOR to automobiles and CO2 emissions.  Most of us are fed up with the lies and the corruption.  God help us because Washington and politicans cannot!</p>

							<p>John Carey: Show the proof for your statement: "the emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming." Proof not opinions and slanted studies masquerauding as facts.</p>

<p>And while you are doing so, explain the following:</p>

<p>Kim Strassel, today’s (June 2009) Wall Street Journal:</p>

<p>"Among the many reasons President Barack Obama and the Democratic majority are so intent on quickly jamming a cap-and-trade system through Congress is because the global warming tide is again shifting. It turns out Al Gore and the United Nations (with an assist from the media), did a little too vociferous a job smearing anyone who disagreed with them as 'deniers.' The backlash has brought the scientific debate roaring back to life in Australia, Europe, Japan and even, if less reported, the U.S.</p>

<p>"In April, the Polish Academy of Sciences published a document challenging man-made global warming. In the Czech Republic, where President Vaclav Klaus remains a leading skeptic, today only 11% of the population believes humans play a role. In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy wants to tap Claude Allegre to lead the country’s new ministry of industry and innovation. Twenty years ago Mr. Allegre was among the first to trill about man-made global warming, but the geochemist has since recanted. New Zealand last year elected a new government, which immediately suspended the country’s weeks-old cap-and-trade program.</p>

<p>"The number of skeptics, far from shrinking, is swelling. Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe now counts more than 700 scientists who disagree with the U.N. — 13 times the number who authored the U.N.’s 2007 climate summary for policymakers. Joanne Simpson, the world’s first woman to receive a Ph.D. in meteorology, expressed relief upon her retirement last year that she was finally free to speak 'frankly' of her nonbelief. Dr. Kiminori Itoh, a Japanese environmental physical chemist who contributed to a U.N. climate report, dubs man-made warming 'the worst scientific scandal in history.' Norway’s Ivar Giaever, Nobel Prize winner for physics, decries it as the 'new religion.' A group of 54 noted physicists, led by Princeton’s Will Happer, is demanding the American Physical Society revise its position that the science is settled. (Both Nature and Science magazines have refused to run the physicists’ open letter.)</p>

<p>"The collapse of the 'consensus' has been driven by reality."</p>

<p>Come off it, John/Dan...</p>

<p>Whatever one’s attitude to greenhouse gas emissions, the point is that they can simply and effectively be lowered just by changes in electricity and transport (4/5 of emissions), changes advantageous in themselves, regardless of the emission reduction bonus that are also brought, without the need for complicated all-involving expensive circuitous cap and trade schemes, and without the need to stop Americans from buying what they want, as with current energy efficiency regulation proposals, the light bulb phase-out being an obvious example.</p>

<p>1. Waxman-Markey goals achieved much more easily and effectively:</p>

<p>–Deal with the Problem<br />
–Keep Life Simple<br />
–Work with -not against- Business and Consumers</p>

<p>Electricity generation (coal/gas) and transport (automobiles),<br />
cause nearly 80% of fossil fuel emissions (EPA data) - a focus on them alone easily reaches first phase 2020 reductions without elaborate expensive cap and trade solutions.</p>

<p>Any other industry is only brought on board in the second phase reduction from 2020 onwards if judged to be needed there and then, based on scientific evidence and evidence of the efficacy of emission reduction measures.</p>

<p>Win-Win for America:<br />
1. Local environmental benefit from the reduction of noxious substances emitted from electricity or transport combustion of hydrocarbon fuel, regardless of any less tangible global benefit from CO2 reduction - and that is one reason why the focus on carbon trading is wrong, compared with the focus on reducing fuel combustion emissions.<br />
2. Energy supply benefit from the diversification of electricity generation with related improved grid distribution and service competition for consumers.<br />
3. Energy supply benefit from the diversification (electrification, hydrogen fuel enablement etc) of transport, reducing the dependency on oil imports.</p>

<p>In 2020, from then available evidence, either<br />
1. There is increasing consensus that global warming can’t be stopped anyway, and that further specific reduction attempts have no value: In that case little has been lost, since the described changes in electricity and transport industry carry their own benefit, or<br />
2. Consensus remains that CO2 emission reduction should continue, in which case America is on track, and may continue with more specific emission reduction efforts for the years 2030 aqnd 2050 that also bring in agriculture, cement, steel and other industry whose businesses hitherto did not need disruption. </p>

<p>Cost to businesses - and the consumers - is kept to a minimum,<br />
by equity and long term loan finance, the latter fed/state guaranteed to keep down interest rates, with slow payback giving little affected consumer electricity bills or car costs.<br />
No disruption of American business practice and planning, by emission trading.<br />
No volatile extra emission trading costs for a range of businesses, passed on to consumers.</p>

<p>Understanding Cap and Trade + why it is bad for America, see<br />
http://ceolas.net/#cce5x</p>

<p>2. The assumption is that all energy efficiency legislation is good for consumers.</p>

<p>Wrong…inefficient products need to have special advantages or noone would want them.<br />
The fact is that efficiency regulation on a product sacrifices performance, construction and price features, and does not necessarily give the savings suggested anyway.</p>

<p>See<br />
http://ceolas.net/#cc2x<br />
onwards regarding efficiency regulation effect on buildings, lightbulbs, cars, dishwashers and other products.</p>

<p>BULL.<br />
The united states emits far less CO2 than China.  Besides, scientists -ones without a political agenda- have shown that solar activity correlates with temperature changes.  In fact, it correlates stronger to changes than CO2 does, and changes in CO2 levels FOLLOW changes in temperature by about 800 years.  the only reason that CO2 and temperature would be increasing at the same time NOW is that temperature increased about 800 years ago.  And by the way, temperatures have been decreasing for a couple of years now.  it's time to update your hockey stick charts to show recent years.</p>

<p>But go ahead, be ignorant and say this is great.  Believe that our government is saving us from disaster when they're really creating one.  What we should be doing is using Nuclear power in the same way France is. </p>

							<p>Shifting away from fossil fuels would be great, if a viable alternative existed. Unfortunately, no such fuel source is yet available, at least, at a cost which won't greatly increase the cost of energy. Since nearly all production & commerce involves substantial energy use, any increase in the cost of energy will decrease overall economic output. Any decrease in economic output, absent a reduction in population, will make people poorer. The Congress is gambling that, by increasing the cost of fossil fuels, conservation & innovation will be accelerated beyond what would occur at a lower energy cost. I fear that the law of diminishing returns will reduce the effectiveness of the conservation efforts. After all, you can only reduce energy use so much before you start spending more money than you will ever save. No insulation or machine is 100% efficient. Spending an infinite amount of money won't get you there. As to trying to speed innovation, the most productive way to do that is simply to increase money for scientific research. The fortune to be earned from any energy breakthrough provides enough incentive for researchers. But they may need more tools in order to progress faster. Maby the great thinkers in the Congress know something that I don't, but I can't see this effort yielding anything but economic hardship. And if the science is wrong, or if the BRIC countries cheat, as is very likely, we have made ourselves poor for nothing. By then, the economic decline that will have occurred, will be exceedingly difficult to reverse. Ask your Senators to vote "nay" on this dangerous experiment.</p>

Not to mention families that are middle to low income will not be able to survive.  As a single parent of 3 I am barely surviving now.  If energy rates raise as well as fuel costs I will not be able to afford to drive to work or have electricity in my home.  What is Obama's plan, to force the middle income further into poverty.  This bill will only serve to send our country further into financial ruins.

Europeans do a much better job at conserving energy.  Americans have long ignored or looked the other way over the environmental impact of toxic emmissions.  So clean air costs more, so what?

If Obama was only a fraction of the true leader that I thought he was going to be, this country would be on course to build 500 nuclear facilities within the next two decades. Every coal plant in the country converted to nuclear.....then every car converted to electric.....then totally clean air and total energy independence.</p>

							<p>It is amazing to read an article like this. Very simply laid out, easy to understand, and extremely transparent. It is filled with flaws of logic and assumptions, used as springboards for their following paragraphs. Assertions that have not been proven (to say the least) are stated with matter of fact confidence, and the article continues until the next unproven premise is stated. It is always curious to me, when reading an article such as this, why even a cursory reading reveals such huge problems. Is it lazy reporting, or intentionally tendentious? By this time, I think it is safe to assume the latter, for there is enough evidence at this point demanding the addition of words such as "controversial", or "theoretical" in reporting on this subject. No wonder I rarely trust main stream media to report on anything remotely involving the wishes, plans, or dreams of the left in  American politics.</p>

<p>A reduction of this magnitude would require a massive downsizing of economic activity and take us back to ~1900.  I would like to see an honest economic analysis of what would be required to to meet the  80% reduction.  Should we stop building new highways and airports today?  Should the stimulus dollars go for bicycle paths instead of highway construction?  What is the long term impact on home prises  as the cost of heating/cooling skyrockets?  What energy intensive industries (aluminum, steel, refining) will move offshore?  Who are the winners (China) and losers (USA/West Virginia)?</p>

<p>I disagree with this bill because it will not change anything.  Industries will simply move their operations to other countries with less restrictive laws; just like they did with the Clean Air and Clean Water acts and OSHA, among other laws.  Oil refineries will move to Mexico and Canada (Canada has looked the other way with regards to CO2 emissions as evident by the development of tar sands).  Remnants of the natural resource and manufacturing industries will move to China (including automakers).  CO2 emissions from ships, trains and trucks will increase because these products will be shipped around.</p>

							<p>I counted 32 responses to this articles and even among those that believe in man-made "global warming" or "climate change" as they like to call it now don't support this bill except 1, Sam, and rightly so. Which poll was John referring to when he said "Polls show the public supports action on climate".</p>

<p>I think "climate change" is also called winter, spring, summer and fall but that's me.  </p>

<p>Most man-made global warming believers are hypocrites like Al Gore and Gov. Mark Sanford. I know, Sanders is a hypocrite for a different reason. The truth is "man-made global warming" is a religion and those that are believers think the rest of us are infidels. </p>

<p>When Mt. St. Helen blew it's top it put an equivalent of 40 years worth of industrial pollution in the atmosphere and that one was small as volcanoes go. Then there are cows, termites and undersea thermo pockets that give off large amounts of methane which is 23x more potent than CO2. Then of course we have solar flares. Do volcanoes, cows and termites have to reduce there emissions? </p>

<p>As noted most of you responding to this article are on the right side of this bill. It's full of crap. But it's not law yet! It still has to pass the Senate where it will have a tougher fight. So e-mail and or call your Senators and tell them to vote no. Better yet educate your friends and have them call the Senators was well. </p>

<p>The reason I say "educate" is because most people has no idea what "cap and trade" is or are only just hearing about it now unless they are still crying about MJ's passing. Seriously, I work around some smart people. But I asked about 12 of them if they knew what "cap and trade" was and although some had heard the term not 1 knew a darn thing about it. This is the real reason our country is declining. Most people are counting on the media to educate them but they have their own agenda.</p>

<p>--This honor goes to the remarkably designed PowerSheet flexible solar cells. Imagine a solar panel without the panel. Nanosolar has created an ink that takes sunlight and converts it into electricity. The ink is coated onto metal sheets as thin as aluminum foil with a printing-press-like device. The sheets are lighter, inexpensive and as efficient as traditional solar panels.

							<p>People will deny global warming is an issue because ultimately it comes down to the realization that our way of life is obscenely wasteful. While I like my life just as much as the rest of you, it doesn't make it right. Other countries don't live to the excess we do - we say it's because we're the most powerful or the best, but really it's because we've been stupid and have subsidized oil in this country for far too long.  In Italy, petrol is like $15 per litre. It's time we join the rest of the world and realize this is an issue - that will be the way we become TRUE leaders.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there will have to be massive destruction (ie: Florida goes under water or millions of people die in hurricanes) before many realize this is a real issue.</p>

<p>CO2 is a bad - "bads" are meant to be taxed.  We need to start looking at CO2 like we do carbon monoxide. When the price of oil increases, people will begin looking for alternatives (it's proven that this begins at $3/gal). It's going to take a long time, but eventually we will have an alternative energy source. </p>

<p>Brazil has a diverse energy portfolio and that is what we need.  We are putting all of our eggs in one basket with petroleum, and just like mom always said, putting all your eggs in one basket is never a good idea.</p>

							<p>Despite most of the comments on this article I think most rational people intuitively realize a fossil fuel based economy is susceptible to disruption, is a finite resource being exhausted progressively faster with each passing year by world industrialization, and similar to smoking cigarettes likely isn’t healthy for the planet or its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Unfortunately society never seems to take anything seriously until it becomes a crisis. So while global warming may be the most serious long term threat – it’s not the only one. Personally I think the potentially catastrophic impacts on our planets and inhabitants health, and economy far outweigh the consequences of beginning to address the issue now, even if that means moderately energy higher costs in the short term.</p>

							<p>One of the Republicans that voted for this bill was Dave Reichart of Washinton. I called his office to ask why he voted yes. I was told that I would get an email outlining his position. <br />
There was no verbal answer because, I believe, he is reading it for the first time now and will post formulate his opinion.<br />
Mittel Steel, largest in the world with many plants in the US, has said they will not expand here but will focus elsewhere because of these changes should they become law.<br />
As we now know, the EPA came out with a statement last week saying that CO2/warming has not been proven and at best is a theory. Of course that was supressed by our new ' Open and Transparent Administration.<br />
So - the EPA says the link between warming and CO2 it is highly questionable. Do those in Congress who criticized the past administration for the ' facts ' of WMD see any parallel here?<br />
Using the CO2 argument to pass this bill is disengenuous at best.<br />
Of course it is wise to use as little energy to get a job done as is possible.<br />
That is just common sense.<br />
That - common sense - is something that should be taught in school. Along with our history and vigorous discussion on Constitutional Law.<br />
Check out the KIPP schools, started in Brooklyn,NY. They operate on small budgets, large class rooms, don't have new buildings or computures or - unionized teachers. The children generally do very well even though they come from self described ' poor ' and/or single parent households.<br />

Unfortunatly the people of America send people to Washington to "represent us" and they forget what they are supposed to do. Evidently everybody in Washington believes that they are supposed to make more laws to restrain more people. I wonder how many laws are on the books and how many I break everyday? And I believe I am a good citizen of our country.  <br />
    Why do some of these proposed bills have to be so long that our representatives cannot possibly have enough time to read them and comprehend what they will do to us. Add to that- ammendments that are 300 pages long and you have a disaster waiting to happen. <br />

							<p>I can understand the idiot Democrats (i.e. socialists) in Congress supporting this abomination,  but these utility CEO's are equally clueless.  Do your research.  Global warming as a crisis is the most massive fraud of our age, particularly when it drives us to engage in such economic masochiusm. Stop being led around by the nose. </p>

<p>The global warming hysteria is a phenomenon of "presentism," an inordinate preoccupation with what is happening now rather than a reflection of a healthy historical perspective. Average world temperatures, to the extent that one can assemble them from a combination of direct measurable observation and paleoclimatological proxies, have fallen within a range of about three degrees C over the past 3,000 years.  From that perspective, the earth is currently just below the average and only about 0.8 C higher than 1850, which is considered the end of the Little Ice Age.</p>

<p>Temperatures were warmer in the Medieval Warm Period 800-1300 A.D.) than they are today and, naturally, without the effects of increased CO2. Though Al Gore, who has unfortunately injected politics into the debate, tries to minimize the MWP, he cannot explain away the historical evidence of Vikings who farmed a Greenland which, today, is under a thick layer of permafrost. Current temperatures are about 1 degree C below the MWP. </p>

<p>Man is probably responsible for a small piece of warming in recent decades, but his contribution pales next to a variety of natural forces, including the 100,000 elliptical cycle, the 41,000 year-year axial cycle, the 23,000-year precession (wobble) cycle, and the 1,500-year solar-driven cycle, as well as  the influences of such factors as clouds, cosmic rays, oceans, water vapor, the urban heat island effect and greenhouse gases. Do the math.  Of the greenhouse gases, water vapor constitutes 60%, carbion dioxide only 20%.  But man's share of the CO2 is only 3.5%. The U.S. share 0.7%</p>

<p>It is ludicrous to make much of such a small increase in the 1979-1998 era, or attribute it primarily due to AGW, after factoring in all these influences.  It is only in the period from 1979-1998 that there is a correspondence of CO2 and slightly higher temperatures (about 0.4 degrees C).  In the other two periods of the 20th century (1916-1945 and 1945-1978), there is no correspondence; one was up in the face of lower levels of CO2 and the other was down in the face of rising CO2.  </p>

<p>Why the preoccupation with CO2 then? Because, unlike all the other factors, it has the potential to be used as a political stick to advance a agenda of regulatory command and control from on high and a lever for international control over American sovereignty. It is no coincidence that Obama appointed Harold Koh, a radical proponent of world government and limitations on American sovereignty as Legal Advisor to the State Department at the same time as he appointed Steven Chu, a far-left global warming advocate, as Secretary of Energy.</p>

<p>Another area on which politics has corrupted the process: purported sea level rise.  Al Gore has predicted a 20-foot rise in sea levels in his propaganda piece shown to many impressionable schoolchildren in the absence of any counter arguments. Senator Lieberman, in 2001, predicted a 35-foot rise. Both are devoid of scientific reality or support.  In reality, sea levels have been rising at the same rate since the end of the last ice age 12,500 years ago and have shown no acceleration in the 20th-21st centuries. The IPCC (2007) predicts a sea level rise of only 8-18 inches by 2,100. The leading sea level scientist, Nils-Axel Mörner, predicts a rise of 4 inches, based on 35 years of direct observational data from points all over the globe.  Sadly, Obama's energy secretary, with no expertise in the field, is predicting major sea level rise, but presents no data to support it. I believe he is simply trying to please his master.</p>

<p>There are far too many global warming alarmism skeptics to dismiss as pawns of big oil, which is common tactic of the political forces aligned in favor of AGW. They simply cannot believe that anyone can arrive at conclusions different than their own unless they have been bought off.  In reality, it is government funding which has corrupted the scientific enterprise far more, to the tune of billions of dollars. Just as lawyers can easily find doctors or other experts to support their cases in courts of law, scientists are also corrupted by money which flows too freely to those who advance desired scientific results.<br />
President Eisenhower warned of this in the 1950s and it has now become re4ality. Many scientists have become whores to the federal grant-making apparatus.  </p>

<p>It is also important to note the dishonesty of the AGW crowd and politicians like Henry Waxman (to name just one) which touts the "unanimous consensus of the IPCC's 2,500 scientists." In reality, there are only 60-700 scientists among the 22,500.  The remainder are government representatives, many of whom view the IPCC as a transfer mechanism whereby American wealth can be moved from our shores to theirs.  CO2, then, becomes a convenient guilt-inducing mechanism for effectuating this transfer.</p>

<p>This debate is primarily a political one.  Though we know many things, the science is still in a relative state of infancy, and certainly nowhere far enough advanced to justify such punitive and economically debilitating measures as cap and trade, the pain from which will be onerous and far-reaching. Ironically, given the fact that the projected reduction of temperature due to cap and trade is likely to be only 0.7 degrees C by 2050, there is no way Congress or anyone else can measure the success of this monstrosity against the other natural factors influencing climate.  In reality, it will constitute the greatest case of economic masochism in our nation’s history<br />

<p>for those who talk of "moderate" increases, most of us can't afford 2000 dollar increases on electric and $6 a gallongas?? how will we pay our bills?? I live in marylnd where it gets ever more expensive due to taxes every year, how will my family make it?? Iam making half of what i wasdue to the economy(commissio only sales) we have already cut to the bone-we don't get to go on vacations on the taxpayer dime like congress or obama..i suspect those who say this get a paycheck not based on production-just show up like a govt job</p>

							<p>Remember all the promises that nothing was going to be done in secret?  The stimulus package was done in secret without any one of the members of congress reading it.  No one in congress has read the cap and trade bill either.  I doubt if they have read the health care bill either.  Why is Obama appointing all of these czars who have no one to accout to but him.  The goverment has no right to be in the banking business, the auto industry, the health care business or anything else that the American people should be able to take care of themselves.  They shouldn't be able to put a cap on anyone's salary or tax rich people unfairly.  We shouldn't be told what we can and cannot eat, how much electricity we use, how much we drive, how to raise our children and all of the other things they are sticking their noses in. If they cut out all of the waste in all governments we wouldn't have such big debts.  If they didn't give welfare and social security to dead people they would have more money for the important things.  <br />
     I have heard a lot of people say that we will just vote these people out in the next election.  At the rate this presidency has gone in just six months, by the time four years are up we may not have elections anymore.  We were told that we would have change, but were never told what the change would be.  We are finding out now.  Some of you who voted for Obama may well wish you had FOUR MORE YEARS OF BUSH, as he kept saying over and over again. From the person with the lowest income to the person with the highest, we all have the right to spend our money as we see fit.  We don't want a Robin Hood president!!<br />
     One final thought.  We have so much crime today.  People killing their familes, school killings, more rapes, robberies, etc.  The media is full of many, many new crimes each day.  The divorce rate is high, abortion is high, drug use is high.  This is because the more we take God out of our lives the more amoral we become.  There is no accounting for actions anymore. There is no fear of punishment. There is no respect for parents, teachers, police officers or anyone else in authority.  You just can't get it through the heads of atheists that believing is not hurting anyone.  It does just the opposite. Before they got their way and stopped all the Christmas Carols and manger scenes in public places, and the ten commandmants, and the pledge of allegiance, and children praying in school this country was a better place. Go to a main library and look up the charter for all fifty states and they all mention God, The Almighty, The Lord in the preamble.  Then tell me that this country was not founded on Christianity.  Also you could not hold public office in the original states UNLESS you believed in God.  It is written in their charters.</p>

I understand there is a provision hidden in this bill to make Class 8 Trucks powered by Natural Gas not Diesel, not that I am against this, but the overall cost for the facilities to provide this and the ocst to trucking companies will be unheard of, and guess what, all of this will go back to the consumer, in the ost of clothes, computers, bread, and milk.</p>

							<p>I do wish I did know what all was in this bill.  I've heard some very far out assertions on that point but have not found the documentation to back it up.  Until I read it in entirety I can't say whether I'm for or against.  I hear much protestation however, about energy bills going up.  Over the last couple years my bills were already rising.  What is new???  Rising bills have led me to seek out alternative fuel for my house.  The result, change.  Those who are strong and adaptable will survive and my children's air quality will be cleaner for it.  Everyone acts as though this is a one issue issue.  Global Warming. But does not polution in general hurt us, our air, our landscape, and our oceans, and all inhabitants of the earth without Global Warming?  I've gone to cities where the air made me sick.  Some Folks are just lazy and resist change by nature. They are without imagination to see all the business opportunities that will arise from this. Come on Folks, The first car was run on soy bean oil, going back to basics is not so scary.</p>

							<p>Although I'm not as informed as some of you, it is blanatly clear that this will only increase taxes.  Whether you are supposedly for the environment like the liberals like to think they are the only ones or you are on the side of commonsense, no one can argue this is a tax hike, but I guess since obama is intent on bankrupting us he has to pay for it somehow.  </p>

When 15,000 scientists around the globe have called Global Warming "scare propaganda" and with more scientists every day recanting their support of this hoax, it's obvious it's not about climate change but about socialist's quest for power.

							<p>The fact of the matter is, the complexities, of the Cap and Trade regulations, are ripe for abuse, and manipulation. Goldman Sachs apparently owns 10% of the Chicagpo Climate Exchange, and will receive commissions on every trade. it is beyond the abilities of the current regime,to forsee, the inevitable manipulation, to the detriment of the consumer. The fact is the consumer will end of paying the bill, as everything the consumer purchases depends on energy. I have been trying to absorb all the contingencies, its confusing, but I have no doubt, the consumer will pay in the end.  </p>

							<p>I really tried to read all of the post, but I must admit tht at the last I did skim across the text putting down the important highlets of each.  I just wonder if that is what the politicians did when this bill came to a vote.  One thing that caught my attention was the time frame in which this bill was posted and the time frame in which the amendments were posted.  It dosen't take much to realize that we were not supposed  to know when it was posted and we were not supposed to know what was in it, because it was posted when most of us were asleep. That in itself is totally wrong.</p>

<p>The follwoing are some observation that I gathered from this blog.<br />
- It is time to wake up and take notice of what our elected officials are up to.<br />
- It is time to vote them out and get new ones if they are so unconserned with what is best for the country.<br />
- It is time to vote them out if they don't fulfill their responsibility to keep their constituiants informed and then in turn listen to what they have to say.<br />
- It is time to stop depending on the government for every facet of our lives.<br />
- It is time we all started taking notice of what is happening in Washington, start talking to our regional representative, congressmen and senators.<br />
- It is time we let our voices be heard.<br />
- It is time we stop blindly accepting what the news media puts out there for us to know.  Do our own reserch, make sure we are getting the truth.  <br />
-It is time to stop believing that change for the sake of change is not necessarily a good thing.<br />
- It is time for us to stop being dependent on foreign oil.<br />
-It is time for us to be thinking of alternative methods of enegy.  Mostly in this area you hear talk of bio-fuels, but no one is doing anything about it.  You also hear talk of wind mills, but not all areas on the country have lots of wind unless it is due to bad weather.  No one has mentioned geo-thermil.<br />
- It is time to stop spending hand over fist for things that will only increase the taxes of those who can not afford to pay in the first place.<br />
- It is time to take stock on the things that do work and concentrate on them to make them better and more productive.<br />
- It is time to keep jobs here, not force business owners to close up shop and move the business to a foreign country.<br />
-It is time to put civics back in school.<br />
-It is time to put God back in our lives, our country and operate this country in the manner it was intended to be operated, for the good of its people.<br />
- It is time to realize that the average American citizen does not have a voice any longer and the ones doing the talking for us are not wearing the same kind of shoes as we and do not understand things the same was as we do.<br />
_It is time we realize that our country is being taken away from us bit by bit and we are sitting back with blank eyes while it happens.</p>

I do not think this bill has been read and understood by those "people" in Washington. This is not an enviromental bill, it is a total invasion into your home. Wake up folks, if this bill passes, it will cost you dearly. To make our home built in 1979, meet min standards we will spend $31,000.00 if we want to be "allowed" to sell it.</p>

							<p>And so "they" (Congress, Canada, the FDA, and the new president) agreed to take the carbon propellants out of asthma inhalers and outlaw it all together. That propellant is being replaced with others - ethanol being one! (It will dissolve fiber glass gas tanks LOL!)GREAT for lungs!</p>

<p>Actually, I am one of the asthmatics who is struggling to breathe when the meds I need are carried with poisons that are only adding to the problem. There are hundreds of us and some have died already.</p>

<p>There is a med I can take without the propellant but I am limited to staying near my breathing machine: so instead of being pretty "regular" with asthma under control, I am now becomming an a stay-at-home semi-invalid.</p>

<p>The irony is - the carbon propellant was inhaled - and almost 100% absorbed while patients held breath to keep the meds from escaping! So it never hurt a fly!</p>

If you weren't a bunch of dumb hicks that get their talking points from Bill O'Reilly, maybe you would be able to see that this bill is a step in the right direction to fix the world. Although it may already be to late because we had a chode of a president for the previous eight years before Obama. </p>

							<p>No matter who or what is the cause of rising/falling tmmperatures, sea levels and other effects of climate change, we need to focus on solving the resultant problems...is it better to provide emergency relief to disaster victims or plan ahead and alleviate the future effects?...stop complaining and find a solution...</p>

							<p>Here is the tax everyone has been waiting for, the air tax. If you breath, you will be taxed. I'm a green guy but this has nothing to do with saving the planet. This only controls what you and industry, has to pay. This b.s., is another attempt for the hole world to pay the biggist corruption cartel, in history. The small guy loses, they win. When you control the air, and make a tax, so you can live. We most assume, they don't care if you can breath, only that you can pay the tax. We must get out of the corrupt U.N., or the spin doctors will win, and we will be slaves!</p>

							<p>I have just come across these comments and have had my breath taken away by the attitude of most of the commentators.  From unsubstantiated claims about thousands of scientists declaring that global warming isn't taking place (seen any comparative pictures of the arctic ice recently?), to claims that it's the fault of the Chinese as they are now the biggest greenhouse gas emitters (yes and there's a problem, but Chinese per capita emissions are a fraction of the per capita emissions in the US - still, along with Canada, the most profligate users, and wasters, of energy in the world).</p>

<p>There IS a problem and the US has been leading the depletion of its natural resources, not least oil, for decades now.  That it should adopt some measures to reel those wasteful habits back in is, however painful, just bringing it back towards a realistic use of the world's resources.  </p>

<p>Logically one could expect that, if we liberated millions of tons of carbon based fuel that had been stored below the earth's surface for millions of years (Creationists are not qualified to enter this debate as they don't recognize how oil forms) in a couple of hundred years, it would have an effect on the atmosphere.  To many (see reference to the Arctic ice) things are already moving faster than we can understand - do we just carry on and hand over a world that could be on its way to irredeemable change for the worse to our children or do we try and do something, however imperfect, to see if we can help?</p>

<p>We have some people writing here who don't apparently want to hear or consider these things, which is a pretty sorry state of affairs.</p>

							<p>Global warming is a JOKE! The scientists that said it is real have come out and admitted that they made every thing up and more than 30,000 other scientists do not believe that it exists.  The scientists that said it is real are idiots how can thay call themselves scientists if they dont even know that plants use CARBON DIOXIDE to live and their waste is OXYGEN!  That is second grade science right there.  United States of America get ready to become a third world country.  Unless we can get people with brains in Washington.  </p>

							<p>The fact is that Climate Change is an undisputed and proven reality. This being so, the Energy Barons acknowledge a 'Cap' is inevitable, so they loaded legislation to allow taxpayer support providing delay tactics 'Trade' that will ultimately mean profits while they find the cheapest or greatest propaganda to imply they are working for a cleaner and safer environment.<br />
Clean-Coal is much the same as 'safe sex or being a little pregnant', and no doubt will used by these people, however the reality is that 'Clean Coal' remains one of the worst CO2 polluters. Next will be extending life of old Nuclear Plants and building many more, while the nuclear waste storage problem still exists, and they will not re-enrich spent-rods because it is 'cheaper' to mine raw material.  </p>

							<p>This bill is just a way for the government to make money. Global warming is not real. It is just a topic for the news media to talk about and a way to make more money. The earth goes through a constant cycle, a lot like the one we are going through right now. Some people need to get their facts straight.</p>

							<p>Global warming is by far the biggest government farce above all the other freedom snuffing farces contrived by our treasonous government. They have hijacked our economy,shoved a marxist health care bill down our throats which congress themselves are excempt,working very hard to get immigration reform passed and on and on they go. All of these programs will raise our taxes more than we can ever imagine, as congress invents new ways to tax the hell out of us, to our destruction.</p>

<p>They hatch up their plans to destroy America behind their closed doors. So much for transparency. We have a secret behind the scences kind of government that does not have our best interest at heart but only their own interest. They vote themselves pay raises,take kickbacks and bribes from lobbyist. Every member of congress are millionaires. And all the while we keep having our standard of living lowered.  They ignore the will of the American people and are very smug about it.Their plan is to redistribute the wealth of America.</p>

<p>Unless millions of Americans protest and fight back these tyrants now, we can all kiss our freedoms goodbye for good. In that event, we will all be living in a nightmare hell hole!</p>

							<p>Whether global warming science is real or not is not the issue.  However, if is false then it is a vast multinational conspiracy beyond the scope of any red threat from the cold war era.  Let’s just say that putting CO2 into our atmosphere with no concern of any environmental impact is a bad thing.  To be good stewards of our health and natural resources would not the cleanest form of energy available be advantageous to us.  Wouldn't a reduction on our dependence on foreign entities, that don't like us in the first place, be a move in the right direction?  Wouldn't any attempts to institute a shift in the way we produce energy create an emerging market?  A cap and trade system would create an auxiliary market where investor and traders stand to make a killing.  If you don't think that the cap and trade will stimulate the economy then you think that capitalist have forgotten how to make money.  At any rate there needs to be an investment in our energy future.  New technologies have to be embraced because that is the direction the consumers and the marketplace are moving.  There is also bound to be a boon for nuclear technology which stands to make a killing since they have little to no carbon foot print.  This legislation is a kick in industries pants to make the move in a more responsible, and independent future.  I really don’t get the doom and gloom scenarios of hyper-inflation, astronomical taxes, and economic collapse that end in revolution if not Armageddon.   Despite how stupid you may think your representatives in Washington are, they are crafty with an insatiable sense of self preservation.  If conditions in this country are such that they may be blamed for Joe Public’s economic hard times they will not get re-elected.  If taxes go through the roof on your representative’s watch then they will be looking for a new job next term.  This is no secret to the politicians.  So cheer up.  This is good news.  Sky isn’t falling and your children may be able to breathe easier in a cleaner greener future. </p>

							<p>I don't know much about global warming claims and whether or not they are real. However, the pollution is doing worse things than melting or not melting things. It is making people sick. Our consumption of oil is making us dependent lapdogs to other countries, and is generally bad. We need to diversify our energy sources. Yeah the costs might be high but change and development is often costly but in the long run it will benefit the United States. We have the opportunity to be on the cutting edge of a new industry, that will make our air and lives healthier. I say this legislation is good definitely not perfect, but it certainly beats having our noses jammed up oil and big business asses. Now with that said, I will leave you to rip this post apart.</p>
