<br><a name="10"><ul><b>1. Baby Food.</b>  The very young are extraordinarily susceptible to pesticides.  Here are some organic baby food brands, <a href="http://www.earthsbest.com/">Earth's Best</a>, <a href="http://www.tenderharvest.com/">Tender Harvest</a>, and <a href="http://www.kidsorganics.com/healthytimes.htm">Healthy Times</a>, which are available for your baby's safety and health.  Or better yet, make your own baby food by cooking and pureeing organic produce.  See <a href="http://www.kidsorganics.com/Make UR own baby food.htm">"Make Your Own Baby Food".</a></ul><ul><b>2. Strawberries.</b>  Enjoy them  while they are in season from local organic farms or buy frozen organic strawberries from your local whole market.</a></ul><ul><b>3. Rice.</b>  Domestic rice has  mega-doses of pesticides, and now, the chemicals companies are producing <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/riceletter040504.cfm">"pharm" rice</a> a crop used to produce and store pharmaceuticals.  Buy organic rice where you can find it!  Store it in an airtight container.  It stores very well.</ul><ul><b>4. Green and Red Bell Peppers.</b> Super sources of Vitamin C, but wrought with pesticides if grown "conventionally".  Buy organic, or, better yet, grow your own.  <a href="http://www.seedsofchange.com/">Seeds of Change</a> has a plethora of organic seeds, and pepper plants prove to be a hardy bunch!</ul><ul><b>5. Got Milk?</b> We hope not, at least, not from <a href="http://www.kidsorganics.com/Definitions Page kidsorganics.htm#conventionally grown">conventionally</a> raised cows.  Today's commercial brands are loaded with antibiotics and <a href="http://www.kidsorganics.com/Definitions Page kidsorganics.htm">growth hormones</a>.  Make sure your milk and other dairy is from organically-fed cows without the extra <a href="http://www.kidsorganics.com/Definitions Page kidsorganics.htm#rBST">rBST, rBGH</a> and antibiotics.<br>If you are feeding your child goat milk, and/or goat products, be aware that our science community has now genetically-mutated a goat to spin silk in her milk.  See <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/gm-food/dn1807"> the New Scientist</a> article.  </ul><ul><b>6. Corn.</b> Corn is typically not a scale tipper when it comes to pesticide residues. But, take into account that 75- 90% of all domestic corn has been genetically-modified, that the average American eats 11 pounds of it, that most cooking oils include corn oil, and that most everything is sweetened with corn syrup, and suddenly, buying organic corn and corn products, makes more than a little sense.  Eat local organic corn in season and freeze some for later, or, leave some kernels to dry, and plant them in the spring.</ul><ul><b>7. Bananas.</b> This tropical favorite has a short window of ripeness and a very long distance to market (quick, how many local banana farms does your town have?).  All of which adds up to a lot of heavy chemical dousing along the way.</ul><ul><b>8. Green Beans.</b> Over 60 different pesticides are used on green beans.  Even beans used in baby food have been found to be contaminated.  </ul><ul><b>9. Peaches.</b> Nothing beats a peach.  Until you realize that they often have the highest rates of illegally-applied pesticides.  Isn't that just peachy . . .</ul><ul><b>10. Apples.</b> A decade after the dangers of Alar were exposed, apples are still soaked in pesticides.  Put only organic apples in your pie.</ul><ul><b>11. Cherries.</b> Cherries, so expensive, so rich, so fabulous, . . . so heavily doused in poison.  Make sure that the cherries in your Cherries Jubilee or Bing Cherry Ice Creams are as clean and wonderful as they were meant to be.</ul><ul><b>12. Celery.</b> Why would anyone think of spraying the heck out of that innocuous little stem vegetable?!  But they do.  Stay organic, the taste of organic celery will amaze you and make you a celery-nibbler once again.</ul><ul><b>13. Apricots and Grapes. </b>   Apricots, Peaches and Grapes, what would summer be without them?  Less toxic!  Keep conventionally grown fruits and veggies, and their pesticide residuals, out of your system or minimize them with a vegetable rinse, such as the one by Healthy Harvest.</ul>

<ul><b>14. Soybeans.</b>  <br>If you are not yet a label-reader, it is time to start.  <br>Everything you buy, from bread to cookies to crackers to margerine to dry mixes, has some sort of soy product in it.  Most soybean in the USA is genetically-modified.  <br>So, why the fuss over modified soy?  <br>Monsanto, in an effort to increase the use (and profit potential) of Round-Up Ready, spliced the herbicide into soybean plant DNA.  Two problems with this action. <br><ul> 1) No matter what you or I do, we can never wash RoundUp Ready herbicide off the soybean--<i>ever</i>.  It is "permanently imbedded".  <br>2) It appears that soy increases production of estrogen.  High estrogen levels facilitate the potential for contracting various <a href="http://www.mercola.com/2001/aug/25/milk2.htm"> cancers</a> and for hastening puberty in young children.</ul><br>Although the jury is still out on whether  <a href="http://www.mercola.com/article/soy/">soy consumption</a>, in general, is beneficial, or whether only fermented soy should be consumed, never, we mean NEVER, consume foods laced with poisons.</ul>

<ul><b>15. Potatoes.</b> <br>Mashed potatoes are delicious and worth the calories, unless they're laden with <a href="http://www.foodnews.org/highpest.php?prod=PFR25J06&amp;">pesticides</a> or have been genetically-modified. <br> When genetically modified, potatoes impair the immune system and <a href="http://www.goodmedicinesociety.com/articles/37fa992p.htm"> shrink the brain, liver and heart</a>.<br>So, mash a clean, real, <b>organic</b> potato and forgo the new-fangled monstrosity.  <br>Got soft, green-sprouting organic potatoes?  Don't <a href="http://www.tracker-outdoors.com/potatoes.htm">toss them,bury them</a>!</ul>

<ul><b>16. Raisins.</b>Concentrated little grapes, concentrated levels of <a href="http://www.foodnews.org/highpest.php?prod=PFR20A09&amp;"> pesticides</a>.</ul>
<ul><b>17. Cucumbers.</b>  Ever wonder why this delicious crisp vegetable was loosing its appeal on your palate?  Yep!  The answer is, once again, pesticides.  The answer to pesticides, is, once again, go organic, or  grow your own. :)  Love you!  </ul><br><blockquote><h4 align="center"><font  color="red">For foods to avoid that have been <a href="http://www.kidsorganics.com/Definitions Page kidsorganics.htm#basic crops">genetically-altered</a>.</font></h4></blockquote>
