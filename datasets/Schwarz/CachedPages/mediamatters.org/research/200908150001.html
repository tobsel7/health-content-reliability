<h2 class="MsoNormal">40+ media
reports debunking false claims of "death panels," euthanasia</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>PolitiFact says "death panel" claims are "pants on fire," "false."</strong> On August 10, PolitiFact.com, a project of the <em>St. Petersburg Times</em>,
<a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fpolitifact.com%2Ftruth-o-meter%2Farticle%2F2009%2Faug%2F10%2Fpalin-death-panel-remark-sets-truth-o-meter-fire%2F">wrote</a>: "We've looked at the inflammatory
claims that the health care bill encourages euthanasia. It doesn't. There's
certainly no 'death board' that determines the worthiness of individuals to
receive care. ... [Palin] said that the
Democratic plan will ration care and 'my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome
will have to stand in front of [President] Obama's
"death panel" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of
their "level of productivity in society," whether they are worthy of health
care.' Palin's statement sounds more like a science fiction movie (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSoylent_Green">Soylent
Green</a>, anyone?) than part of an actual bill before Congress. We rate
her statement Pants on Fire!" Addressing a revised version of Palin's claim in
a subsequent post, PolitiFact <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politifact.com%2Ftruth-o-meter%2Fstatements%2F2009%2Faug%2F13%2Fsarah-palin%2Fpalin-claims-obama-misled-when-he-said-end-life-co%2F">wrote</a> on August 13: "The fact is that there is nothing
in the health care bill that would <em>require</em>
people to get the end-of-life counseling. Perhaps, as [<em>The Washington Post</em>'s Charles] Lane - and by
extension Palin - argues, patients might feel some subtle pressure from a
doctor to get the counseling. But <em>the
patients </em>make the call. That's the definition of voluntary." PolitiFact added: "We've
said in our previous item that it was voluntary and we see nothing in Palin's
argument that proves otherwise. And so we rule her claim False."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>PolitiFact previously determined that McCaughey's claim was "a ridiculous
falsehood."</strong> PolitiFact stated: "For our ruling on this one,
there's really no gray area here. McCaughey incorrectly states that the bill
would require Medicare patients to have these counseling sessions and she is
suggesting that the government is somehow trying to interfere with a very
personal decision. And her claim that the sessions would 'tell [seniors] how to
end their life sooner' is an outright distortion. Rather, the sessions are an
option for elderly patients who want to learn more about living wills, health
care proxies and other forms of end-of-life planning." The article concluded:
"McCaughey isn't just wrong, she's spreading a ridiculous falsehood. That's a
Pants on Fire." [PolitiFact.com, <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politifact.com%2Ftruth-o-meter%2Fstatements%2F2009%2Fjul%2F23%2Fbetsy-mccaughey%2Fmccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi%2F">7/23/09</a>]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>FactCheck.org: McCaughey's claim of mandatory counseling
on ending seniors' lives is "a misrepresentation." </strong>Under the heading "False: The House Bill Requires
Suicide Counseling," FactCheck
wrote of McCaughey's assertion: "This is a misrepresentation. What the bill
actually provides for is voluntary Medicare-funded end-of-life counseling. In
other words, if seniors choose to make advance decisions about the type of care
and treatments they wish to receive at the end of their lives, Medicare will
pay for them to sit down with their doctor and discuss their preferences. There
is no requirement to attend regular sessions, and there is absolutely no
provision encouraging euthanasia." [FactCheck.org, <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Ffactcheck.org%2F2009%2F08%2Fseven-falsehoods-about-health-care%2F">8/14/09</a>]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>ABC
medical editor said "the idea about death panels" is "not at all legitimate."</strong> On the August 13 edition of ABC's <em>Good Morning America, </em>ABC chief medical
editor Dr. Tim Johnson <a href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200908130013" target="_blank" title="blocked::http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200908130013
http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200908130013">told</a> anchor Chris Cuomo that "the idea
about death panels -- that this plan is going to decide who lives and
dies" is "not at all legitimate." Johnson continued, "What
is in one of the versions is a so-called advanced care planning provision,
allowing patients who want it -- entirely voluntary -- to have a consultation
with their health care professionals every five years to talk about directives
and living wills and things like that that might help them plan for the future
as they're getting older." He added, "But,
I stress, it's entirely voluntary. It's not at all mandatory."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>ABC's
Snow on </strong><em><strong>World
News</strong></em><strong>:
"The facts? The provision would create no such panel"; "death
panel" claim is "misinformation."</strong> ABC's Kate Snow
said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">SNOW: At issue: a 10-page
section of a thousand-page House health care reform bill. It would reimburse a
doctor for talking with a patient every five years about what kind of care they
want near the end of life. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin called this
"downright evil," asserting her parents and her child with Down
syndrome would have to stand in front of an Obama "death
panel" so his bureaucrats can decide whether
they're worthy of health care.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The facts? The <a name="ORIGHIT_1"></a><a name="HIT_1"></a>provision
would create no such panel. It calls only for a consultation between the
individual and a practitioner. So how did this misinformation start? [ABC's <em>World News</em>, <a href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200908100059" target="_blank" title="blocked::http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200908100059

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>AP
fact check: "No 'death panel in health care bill.' "</strong> In an August 11 article headlined "<a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fapnews.myway.com%2Farticle%2F20090811%2FD9A0HFQO0.html" target="_blank" title="blocked::http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090811/D9A0HFQO0.html
http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090811/D9A0HFQO0.html">FACT CHECK: No 'death panel' in health care bill</a>,"
the AP reported, "Palin says the health care overhaul bill would set up a
'death panel.' Federal bureaucrats would play God, ruling on whether ailing
seniors are worth enough to society to deserve life-sustaining medical care.
Palin and other critics are wrong. Nothing in the legislation would carry out
such a bleak vision. The provision that has caused the uproar would instead
authorize Medicare to pay doctors for counseling patients about end-of-life
care, <em>if the patient wishes</em>"
[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Separate
AP article:</strong>
"[T]here will be no 'death panels' under the legislation being considered." In
an August 14 <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wtop.com%2F%3Fnid%3D116%26sid%3D1739416">article</a>,
the AP reported: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">[T]here will be no "death panels" under the
legislation being considered. In fact, the provision in the bill would allow
Medicare to pay doctors for voluntary counseling sessions that address
end-of-life issues. The conversations between doctor and patient would include
living wills, making a close relative or a trusted friend your health care
proxy, learning about hospice as an option for the terminally ill, and
information about pain medications for people suffering chronic discomfort. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>AP also
debunked McCaughey's claim.</strong> In an August 2 <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wtoc.com%2FGlobal%2Fstory.asp%3Fs%3D10833008%26clienttype%3Dprintable">article</a> about "[c]onfusing claims and
outright distortions" in the health care debate, the AP noted that House
Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) claimed the House bill "may start us down a
treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia" and that
McCaughey alleged, " 'One troubling provision of the House bill compels seniors
to submit to a counseling session every five years ... about alternatives for
end-of-life care." The article then explained "the facts" as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">The bill would require Medicare to pay for advance directive
consultations with health care professionals. But it would not require anyone
to use the benefit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Advance directives lay out a patient's wishes for
life-extending measures under various scenarios involving terminal illness,
severe brain damage and situations. Patients and their families would consult
with health professionals, not government agents, if they used the proposed
benefit. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Time</em>'s Tumulty: "no one is proposing
anything like" what Palin is talking about.</strong> On the Swampland blog, <em>Time </em>magazine's Karen
Tumulty quoted Palin saying that "Obama's 'death panel'
" system is "downright evil," and then wrote: "Yes, such a system would
indeed be downright evil. Which is why no one is proposing anything like it.
Let's repeat: <em>No one is proposing anything
like it</em>"

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">The stubborn yet false rumor that President Obama's health
care proposals would create government-sponsored "death panels" to decide which
patients were worthy of living seemed to arise from nowhere in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Advanced even this week by Republican stalwarts including
the party's last vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, and Charles E.
Grassley, the veteran Iowa senator, the nature of the assertion nonetheless
seemed reminiscent of the modern-day viral Internet campaigns that dogged Mr.
Obama last year, falsely calling him a Muslim and questioning his nationality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[...]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is nothing in any of the legislative proposals that
would call for the creation of death panels or any other
governmental body that would cut off care for the critically ill as a
cost-cutting measure. But over the course of the past few months, early, stated
fears from anti-abortion conservatives that Mr. Obama would
pursue a pro-abortion, pro-euthanasia agenda, combined with twisted accounts of
actual legislative proposals that would provide financing for optional
consultations with doctors about hospice care and other ''end of life'' services,
fed the rumor to the point where it overcame the debate. </p>

                    That&#39;s nice.  Now make the insanity of the republican party your top news story for the next couple months.  I want round the clock coverage.  All pundits should adopt the default position that the republican party is insane, and all guests -- democratic or republican -- should be asked why the republican party is insane.<br>
<br>
(The portion of republicans who never bought into the insanity is insignificant.  Limbaugh bought into it, and he&#39;s 90% of the republican party.)<br>
<br>
This claim was so ridiculous that a sentient person laughs just by hearing it.  Tell it to me out of the blue, and I would instantly bet a thousand dollars that there isn&#39;t an ounce of truth in it without doing the slightest fact-checking.

                    Off Topic Alert...<br>
<br>
Well, not too far off topic. For an interesting change of perspective, imagine this:<br>
<br>
Since the 19th Century, all potable water in the country has been provided by private industry. All the water pumped into homes, all the water served in restaurants, purchased in bottles, all of it comes from a mix of private and public for-profit companies. In 2009, President Obama is sworn in, after having made &#39;water policy&#39; reform a major tenet of his campaign. Legislation is introduced, proposing a government water system that would give the American people a choice over whether to buy their water from the government or from the same companies they&#39;ve been doing business with all their lives.<br>
<br>
Now imagine the Republicans opposing this. &quot;Companies won&#39;t be able to compete, and will soon be driven out of business. How can we let government control such an important resource? It&#39;s socialism!&quot; Then, a couple of months into the debate, and after a skewed reading of the legislation, where &#39;taste&#39; and &#39;purity&#39; standards are discussed, they find the argument they&#39;re looking for. &quot;The government is going to force Americans to drink flouridated water!&quot; And we&#39;re off and running.<br>
<br>
I wouldn&#39;t propose this shift of context except for two things: It nicely highlights how silly Republicans look trying to fight the coverage reform that a majority of Americans support. It also demonstrates their willingness to appeal to any crackpot idea at all so long as it makes their political point for them, regardless of its basis in fact or indeed rationality.<br>
<br>
Most of us drink municipal water. The water in the toilet, supplied by your local government, turned out to be cleaner than the ice cubes McDonald&#39;s was putting in your drink, remember? And, is Evian or Dasani out of business? No.<br>
<br>
On top of this foolishness, we now have people demanding that if Congress passes a public option, that Congress be forced to cover themselves with the public option regardless of their wishes. So, the protesters are complaining about a perceived chance of a lack of choice at some future date, but want to take that very choice away from Congress. If the those in Congress want to be insured under the public option, let them. If they wish to pay for private insurance, let them. The same option is being offered to the American people! Choice, folks.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to choice, something that we definitely need more of in the arena of health insurance.<br>
<br>
As for Palin&#39;s &#39;death panel&#39;, in the theoretical example cited above, she&#39;d be arguing that the government was going to use it&#39;s newfound power over the fresh water supply to drown old people.

                    there has been debunking of this smear.  Not to mention on the whole the smear is just outright stupid.<br>
So, why is it that so many people still want to believe it?  why do they grab onto the myth but, reject or ignore the facts?<br>
People just want to find a reason to be afraid and to back away from the scariness of changing something.  They may wish for health care reform, ect., but, when it comes to actually doing it and leaving behind the stale status quo, they latch onto any excuse to back off from it.

                    I have friends in out here in the God fearing state of Utah that keep the TV tuned to Fox news all day, and not for its comedic worth. Add in organizations that spend millions to foment misinformation and you are guaranteed to have a vocal minority that the news loves to record. This is managed by professional PR firms. PR is one of the useless services that the U.S. is still very good at.

                    change is scary ... ANY change.  This is what the moneyed and mega corporations know (they don&#39;t want change either - means they lose big-time), so it&#39;s really scared people telling other scared people lies and campfire terror stories working on people&#39;s fear of the dark and strange noises ... and NOT telling them that all they have to do is turn on their flashlight ...or look up at the stars ... or explain what the noises are and if they are safe or not ... <br>

PBS is doing just this kind of education and their good work is not cited anywhere ... even on this site ...  Anyone listen to Bill Moyers last night?  Quit giving all this energy to the nuts ...

I don&#39;t buy that.  They would be all over this proposal if it came from a conservative president.  In the same way that they don&#39;t like deficits but they&#39;re okay with one if it means a tax cut for the richest.  And they don&#39;t like big government, unless it means an entirely new cabinet position proposed by a conservative.  And they think everyone should mind their own business, unless it&#39;s a war proposed by a born again president who talks to God, or it involves deciding what sex practices are acceptable for others.<br>

                    Well, you have a point.  Wouldn&#39;t it have been nice if we had been so skeptical about invading Iraq?  How would the FOXbats have depicted town hall meetings in which Liberals stood up and shouted down Republican Congressmen who were trying to justify the war?  What if Liberals had paraded around with pictures of Bush with a Hitler moustache and chanted &quot;Hell No&quot; to the invasion?  My, what a different reaction we would have seen.

                    You nailed it. My conservative friends who are still blinded by their partisan nature are all about criticizing Obama for deficits  but never mentioned them when it was Bush spending like a madman and not taxing enough.<br>
<br>
I, for one on the right, am fed up with this hatred and misinformation. I understand  that politicians often don&#39;t tell the whole truth about their opponents, or themselves. But the people in power on the right are going too far, too often.

                    None of this matters to the <b>faithful</b>.  They have been thoroughly &quot;educated&quot; to reject objective analysis as biased propaganda and believe that corporate PR campaigns are advocates for their vested interests.  The right-wing media is using these pawns to further their agenda of obstructing anything put forth by someone with a &quot;D&quot; after their name.  And those charlatans like Limbaugh and Hannity are laughing all the way to the bank.  If you&#39;ve ever had a debate with a true believer and introduced data like a CBO analysis or WHO report or an IPCC report, etc. then you understand why factual information is totally useless.  It is rejected out-of-hand as propaganda.

                    Congratulations....but let me remind everyone of two things..<br>
<br>
how many people will still claim <b>&quot;Al Gore Invented the Internet&quot;</b>?   It&#39;s literally the butt of a joke and no amount of rational facts will dissuade that. I was one of those people back in 1994 who jumped up and founded a dot-com and knows wthat a top level domain is.<br>
<br>
and &quot;a lie can get halfway around the world before truth gets its pants on.&quot;  And that was before the internet and TV!<br>
<br>
I would hate to count how many people are <b>CERTAIN</b> there are death panels.

                    I think Chuck Todd let slip a dirty little Media Secret this morning.  He admitted that only about 20% of the Town Hall meetings were turning into shouting matches.  WTF?  I never would have believed it to be so low from the coverage.  I thought the Troglodytes were popping up at ALL town hall meetings all across the country. Could it be that this is the Shark Attack syndrome of Media Coverage playing out in our Political Debates?   <br>
<br>
In other words, the loudmouths are getting all the attention, as intended, even though they represent a tiny minority.  FOX bobbleheads keep insisting that this &quot;movement&quot; is too massive and widespread to be artificial.  Apparently that&#39;s just another lie from FOX which has been perpetuated by the MSM in the name of ratings.

Health Czar Sebelius said that they are willing to drop the &quot;public option&quot; and the &quot;death panel&quot; provisions and return to the negotiating table.<br>
