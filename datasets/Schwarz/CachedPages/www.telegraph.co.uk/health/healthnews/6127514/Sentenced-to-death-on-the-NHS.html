<p>
But this approach can also mask the signs that their condition is improving, 
  the experts warn. 
</p>
<p>
As a result the scheme is causing a &ldquo;national crisis&rdquo; in patient care, the 
  letter states. It has been signed palliative care experts including 
  Professor Peter Millard, Emeritus Professor of Geriatrics, University of 
  London, Dr Peter Hargreaves, a consultant in Palliative Medicine at St 
  Luke&rsquo;s cancer centre in Guildford, and four others. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Forecasting death is an inexact science,&rdquo;they say. Patients are being 
  diagnosed as being close to death &ldquo;without regard to the fact that the 
  diagnosis could be wrong. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As a result a national wave of discontent is building up, as family and 
  friends witness the denial of fluids and food to patients." 
</p>
<p>
The warning comes just a week after a report by the Patients Association 
  estimated that up to one million patients had received poor or cruel care on 
  the NHS. 
</p>
<p>
The scheme, called the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), was designed to reduce 
  patient suffering in their final hours. 
</p>
<p>
Developed by Marie Curie, the cancer charity, in a Liverpool hospice it was 
  initially developed for cancer patients but now includes other life 
  threatening conditions. 
</p>
<p>
It was recommended as a model by the National Institute for Health and 
  Clinical Excellence (Nice), the Government&rsquo;s health scrutiny body, in 2004. 
</p>
<p>
It has been gradually adopted nationwide and more than 300 hospitals, 130 
  hospices and 560 care homes in England currently use the system. 
</p>
<p>
Under the guidelines the decision to diagnose that a patient is close to death 
  is made by the entire medical team treating them, including a senior doctor. 
</p>
<p>
They look for signs that a patient is approaching their final hours, which can 
  include if patients have lost consciousness or whether they are having 
  difficulty swallowing medication. 
</p>
<p>
However, doctors warn that these signs can point to other medical problems. 
</p>
<p>
Patients can become semi-conscious and confused as a side effect of 
  pain-killing drugs such as morphine if they are also dehydrated, for 
  instance. 
</p>
<p>
When a decision has been made to place a patient on the pathway doctors are 
  then recommended to consider removing medication or invasive procedures, 
  such as intravenous drips, which are no longer of benefit. 
</p>
<p>
If a patient is judged to still be able to eat or drink food and water will 
  still be offered to them, as this is considered nursing care rather than 
  medical intervention. 
</p>
<p>
Dr Hargreaves said that this depended, however, on constant assessment of a 
  patient&rsquo;s condition. 
</p>
<p>
He added that some patients were being &ldquo;wrongly&rdquo; put on the pathway, which 
  created a &ldquo;self-fulfilling prophecy&rdquo; that they would die. 
</p>
<p>
He said: &ldquo;I have been practising palliative medicine for more than 20 years 
  and I am getting more concerned about this &ldquo;death pathway&rdquo; that is coming 
  in. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is supposed to let people die with dignity but it can become a 
  self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Patients who are allowed to become dehydrated and then become confused can be 
  wrongly put on this pathway.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
He added: &ldquo;What they are trying to do is stop people being overtreated as they 
  are dying. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a very laudable idea. But the concern is that it is tick box medicine 
  that stops people thinking.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
He said that he had personally taken patients off the pathway who went on to 
  live for &ldquo;significant&rdquo; amounts of time and warned that many doctors were not 
  checking the progress of patients enough to notice improvement in their 
  condition. 
</p>
<p>
Prof Millard said that it was &ldquo;worrying&rdquo; that patients were being &ldquo;terminally&rdquo; 
  sedated, using syringe drivers, which continually empty their contents into 
  a patient over the course of 24 hours. 
</p>
<p>
In 2007-08 16.5 per cent of deaths in Britain came about after continuous deep 
  sedation, according to researchers at the Barts and the London School of 
  Medicine and Dentistry, twice as many as in Belgium and the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If they are sedated it is much harder to see that a patient is getting 
  better,&rdquo; Prof Millard said. 
</p>
<p>
Katherine Murphy, director of the Patients Association, said: &ldquo;Even the 
  tiniest things that happen towards the end of a patient&rsquo;s life can have a 
  huge and lasting affect on patients and their families feelings about their 
  care. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Guidelines like the LCP can be very helpful but healthcare professionals 
  always need to keep in mind the individual needs of patients. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no one size fits all approach.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
A spokesman for Marie Curie said: &ldquo;The letter highlights some complex issues 
  related to care of the dying. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient was developed in response to 
  a societal need to transfer best practice of care of the dying from the 
  hospice to other care settings. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The LCP is not the answer to all the complex elements of this area of health 
  care but we believe it is a step in the right direction.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
The pathway also includes advice on the spiritual care of the patient and 
  their family both before and after the death. 
</p>
<p>
It has also been used in 800 instances outside care homes, hospices and 
  hospitals, including for people who have died in their own homes. 
</p>
<p>
The letter has also been signed by Dr Anthony Cole, the chairman of the 
  Medical Ethics Alliance, Dr David Hill, an anaesthetist, Dowager Lady 
  Salisbury, chairman of the Choose Life campaign and Dr Elizabeth Negus a 
  lecturer in English at Barking University. 
</p>
<p>
A spokesman for the Department of Health said: &ldquo;People coming to the end of 
  their lives should have a right to high quality, compassionate and dignified 
  care. 
</p>
<p>
"The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) is an established and recommended tool 
  that provides clinicians with an evidence-based framework to help delivery 
  of high quality care for people at the end of their lives. 
</p>
<p>
"Many people receive excellent care at the end of their lives. We are 
  investing &pound;286 million over the two years to 2011 to support implementation 
  of the End of Life Care Strategy to help improve end of life care for all 
  adults, regardless of where they live.&rdquo;
