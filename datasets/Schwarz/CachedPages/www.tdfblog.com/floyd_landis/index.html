<h3>Shades of gray</h3>


<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50816637@N00/3870823874" title="View 'Landis preparing' on Flickr.com"><img border="0"width="159"style="float:left;"alt="Landis preparing"src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2524/3870823874_10e24255cc_m.jpg" height="240" vspace="8" hspace="8"/></a>There are a lot of cycling fans who still believe in black and white.</p>

<p>Some rider or another, they'll say, has never tested positive, or is the most tested athlete in the world. Team X, they'll say, has the strictest anti-doping program in the peloton. Sure, there used to be a lot of doping in the sport, they'll say, but no sport has such extensive athlete testing, and the sport today is clean.</p>

<p>I've been following the sport for 25 years, through the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/us/stamina-building-drug-linked-to-athletes-deaths.html?pagewanted=all">mysterious deaths while riders slept</a>, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/28/sports/28iht-BIKE.1.5894396.html">60 hematocrits</a>, and now <a href="http://www.uci.ch/Modules/ENews/ENewsDetails.asp?MenuId=&amp;id=NTQzOA&amp;LangId=1">the biological passport</a>, and I'm convinced the sport has never in that time approached clean. I don't believe in black and white.</p>

<p>The way I've come to see modern cycling is that every rider exists in a Heisenberg bubble, balanced somewhere on a scale between pure as the driven snow white and Floyd Landis &ldquo;hell yeah I doped&rdquo; black. As a fan, we all calculate the likelihood a particular rider is juicing, and all most of us have to go on is the rider and his team's public pronouncements, and the rider's race performance. How much you like a rider has to be balanced against how likely you think it is a) that he or she has doped, and b) that he or she will get caught. This is why I and many others breathed a sigh of relief when <a href="http://www.morethanthegames.co.uk/cycling/1910838-giro-ditalia-porte-seizes-maglia-rosa-day-drama">Vinokourov lost the <i>maglia rosa</i> at the Giro</a>. I believe Vino's failed dope test was accurate, and I fear he has likely returned to his previously successful ways. You, of course, may disagree, or feel just as fearful about Giro winner Ivan Basso, who was ultimately banned for his involvement in <i>Operaci&oacute;n Puerto</i>, and now says he's gunning for a podium spot at the Tour. One of the things about the bubble is that every fan's is slightly different. Maybe you assume that everyone who came out of the sports mills of Eastern Europe is tainted. Maybe you believe that the recent popularity of Spain as a training center was a direct result of tighter French anti-doping laws.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frank_steele/469500065/" title="Tyler Hamilton &amp;amp; David Millar by Frank Steele, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/469500065_c8569000e9_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" align="right" hspace="8" alt="Tyler Hamilton &amp;amp; David Millar"></a>Occasionally, especially in the case of a superstar rider, there may be other information, from former teammates, employees, trainers, or other people in the rider's circle. In the absence of positive dope tests, which it still appears can be manipulated without a great deal of trouble, all we can do is take the data and put it together with our own prejudices and preferences to decide who we believe is clean and who's not. If an ex-teammate says you've doped, that moves you 3 spaces to the right. Coming out of nowhere to contend for the climber's jersey at the Tour? Move 10 spaces to the right. If you get caught, suspended, then come back as an anti-dope crusader, that might move you a space or two to the left.</p>

<p>It's apparent that there's a continuing arms race in cycling, and the enforcers are losing. Like any arms race, the advantage goes to those with money and technology, and those belong to the teams.</p>

<p><a href="http://view.picapp.com/pictures.photo/sports/tour-2010-prologue/image/9268329?term=Lance+Armstrong" target="_blank"><img src="http://view1.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9268329/tour-2010-prologue/tour-2010-prologue.jpg?size=234&amp;imageId=9268329" border="0" width="234" title="Le Tour 2010 - Prologue" height="156" align="right" hspace="8" oncontextmenu="return false;" ondrag="return false;" onmousedown="return false;" alt="ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS - JULY 01: Cyclist Lance Armstrong pauses at the start of the team presentations for the 97th Tour de France on July 1, 2010 in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)" /></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://view.picapp.com//JavaScripts/OTIjs.js"></script>Far be it from me to identify where I think any particular rider falls on the 0-to-100 scale. Clearly, though, the recent Landis revelations, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704911704575326753200584006.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEADNewsCollection">outlined in detail in the Wall Street Journal today</a>, push Armstrong farther to the right, and at least nudge Zabriskie, Hincapie, and Leipheimer in that direction. Sure, it's easy to impeach Landis' credibility, but it's clear to me that Landis didn't come up with the sophisticated doping program he's described, and he's far from the first person to allege that Armstrong has relied on more than spring water in previous Tour wins.</p>

<p>Let's run through the allegations in the WSJ article by Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell. First and foremost, there are dates and details of blood transfusions during the Tour de France itself in 2004, and a partial list of riders who received them, including Armstrong. Next most damaging is probably Landis' claim that Armstrong himself was the source of his first collection of testosterone patches. Finally, there is the allegation that as many as 60 team bikes were sold for cash to support the Postal doping program. For me, mentions of Armstrong's possible visits to strip bars and cocaine use are just distractions; my interest is in Armstrong as an athlete or a cheat.</p>

<p>According to Albergotti and O'Connell, three other U.S. Postal riders confirmed doping while Armstrong rode for the team, and one admitted he himself doped.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frank_steele/2442190470/" title="Frankie Andreu by Frank Steele, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2056/2442190470_1e50273445_m.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" width="240" height="240" alt="Frankie Andreu"></a>Looking through the article, though, I don't see anything that's going to change the mind of rabid Armstrong fans, or of people who have believed he's a doper since 1999. We <a href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2006/09/news/former-posties-admit-to-doping-as-prep-for-99-tour_10851">already know of former teammates who have alleged doping</a>, including Frankie Andreu, who admitted his own EPO use in 2006. The claim that team bikes were improperly sold to pay for the doping program can't be proven by the mere appearance of team bikes on eBay: Someone would have to connect their proceeds to a doping program to really make something of it. Otherwise, those frames could just as easily have gone toward Armstrong's Shiner Bock habit as toward dope. I can see no way to tie Armstrong to the foil-packeted testosterone Landis claims he was provided.</p>

<p>But the addition of FDA special agent Jeff Novitzky adds a new dimension to the sport's doping problem. Teammates and staff who don't hesitate to cover for a rider with the media may feel differently when a federal agent starts threatening purgery charges and deploys subpoena powers. Novitzky seems unlikely to tolerate the shades of gray we as fans have grown to accept.</p>

<h3>US Pro Time Trial Championship today</h3>


<p>The pros are contesting the US time trial title later today in Greenville. I'm on the scene, snapping photos like crazy, and am looking forward to the Tweetup at 3:30 at <a href="http://www.barleystaproom.com/">Barley's Taproom</a> in downtown Greenville.</p>

<p>It's the same course as last year, won by David Zabriskie for his third consecutive title. It's an up-and-down course, very well-suited to spectators, and Zabriskie has to be the favorite to repeat. <a href="http://www.usacyclingchampionships.com/images/stories/pdf/USProITTStartList01.pdf">Here's the start list</a> and a <a href="http://www.usacyclingchampionships.com/images/stories/pdf/09_US_PRO_TT_Map_v2.pdf">course map</a>. The TT at the Tour of Utah last week threw a bit of a monkey wrench into the works, as Tom Zirbel, 2nd in Greenville last year, beat Captain America by 25 seconds on a flatter course. Other guys to watch are Stephen Cozza, Ben Jacques-Maynes and Scott Zwizanski. Floyd Landis races the Greenville circuit for the first time.</p>

No one has done a better job following the Floyd Landis case than David Brower, Bill Hue, and a gaggle of interested commenters and guest posters over at <a href="http://www.trustbut.com/">Trust But Verify</a>. Today, with the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/more/06/30/landis.ap/index.html">announcement that Floyd Landis has lost his final appeal</a> to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, Hue offers <a href="http://trustbut.blogspot.com/2008/06/requiem-for-champion.html">a fitting coda to the Landis circus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Floyd is my hero because in the face of the biggest travesties of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; I have ever seen, he stood proud, determined, true to himself and his family and did not bow to those who define &ldquo;the game&rdquo; by making its rules, prosecuting those deemed to violate those rules and then stack the deck with those responsible to judge those &ldquo;violations&rdquo;. He made them work for it and we are all the beneficiaries of his efforts even though he ultimately derived no benefit, whatsoever.</blockquote>

<p>I go back and forth on the ultimate question of Floyd's guilt or innocence, but I absolutely agree that the rush by organizers and WADA to be tougher and tougher on drugs has trampled the ideals of fair play, sportsmanship, and athletes' rights. It's unfortunate the riders don't have the leverage to create something akin to the major league baseball players' union.</p>

<p>Landis was also ordered to pay $100,000 toward the US Anti-Doping Agency's legal costs. He is eligible to return to racing in January 2009, just in time for the Tour of California, but I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) he would be subject to the no-UCI-teams-for-2-additional-years proviso (assuming there's still a UCI in 2009).</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>Court of Arbitration for Sport: <a href="http://www.tas-cas.org/en/infogenerales.asp/4-3-1179-1092-4-1-1/5-0-1092-15-1-1/">Bulletin</a> | <a href="http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/1418/5048/0/Award%20Final%20Landis%20(2008.06.30).pdf">Full decision (.pdf file)</a></p>

<p>Immediately after last year's Tour, Landis was accused of cheating when a urine test suggested Landis had an elevated ratio of epitestosterone-to-testosterone, which should normally be approximately equal. Landis has fought the charge, and still has the option of appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<p>The three-man panel found that the Chatenay-Malabry lab near Paris mishandled Landis's sample, but 2 of 3 panelists felt that a follow-up test with a mass spectrometer was convincing evidence that Landis had used synthetic testosterone. Chris Campbell, who was named by the Landis team and also <a href="http://www.tdfblog.com/2005/04/hamilton_receiv.html">dissented in the Tyler Hamilton case</a>, was the dissenting voice. &ldquo;The documents supplied by LNDD are so filled with errors that they do not support an Adverse Analytical Finding. Mr. Landis should be found innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pat McQuaid:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;It's not a great surprise considering how events have evolved. He got a highly qualified legal team who tried to baffle everybody with science and public relations. And in the end the facts stood up.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Right -- we wouldn't want to get science mixed up in all this.</p>

<p><a href="http://trustbut.blogspot.com/2007/09/hues-view.html">TrustButVerify notes</a> that the suspension is to run through January 29, 2009, which, to me, seems a bit punitive, given that Landis has not competed since the end of July, 2006.</p>

<p>CyclingNews quotes Pat McQuaid that Pereiro will inherit the 2006 Tour title, but I don't think, given the state of relations between the ASO and the UCI, I would take that to the bank. We've already got a Tour without a winner, the 1996 edition, since Bjarne Riis admitted to doping during that Tour. I'm sure the ASO will weigh in shortly.</p>

<h3>Tour organizers: Bjarne who?</h3>


<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/6730351.stm">BBC SPORT | Tour takes Riis off winners list</a></p>

<p>Tour de France organizers are telling the press that Bjarne Riis has been stricken from the Tour winners list after his admission last month that he used EPO for 6 seasons, including 1996, when he won the Tour.</p>

<blockquote>Tour spokesman Philippe Sudres said: "We have removed him from the list because of the doping admission.

<p>"We consider philosophically that he can no longer claim to have won." </blockquote></p>

<p>Two issues: 1) A quick look at the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/">official Tour website</a> shows that <a href="http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/TDF/1996/us/annee.html?RaceYear=1996&amp;x=57&amp;y=11">Riis is right there were he's always been</a>, atop the 1996 Tour. </p>

<p>2) Who, then, deserves the win? Jan Ullrich, who was 2nd in '96 riding alongside Riis at EPO-fueled Telekom? Richard Virenque in 3rd, riding for Festina, which gave us the most scandalous Tour since 1904?</p>

<p>The cynic in me wonders if this is a first step toward eventually declaring that the 2006 Tour had no winner. Some Tour officials have already said they don't consider Floyd Landis last year's winner, and now with <a href="http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/12277.0.html">Oscar Pereiro refusing to take a DNA test</a> to clear up speculation that he's &ldquo;Urko&rdquo; in the <i>Operaci&oacute;n Puerto</i> athlete files, organizers may prefer to have no winner to having an appointed and controversial winner.</p>

<p>Landis, facing possible disqualification for a high testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio, is expected to publish <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416950230?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nicestoftheda-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1416950230">Positively False: The Real Story of How I Won the Tour de France</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nicestoftheda-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1416950230" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></i> in late June, addressing his childhood as a Mennonite, his racing career, and his efforts to clear his name and return to racing.</p>

<p>Last week, Landis agreed not to race in France this year, and he faces a May hearing in front of the US Anti-Doping Agency and June proceedings from AFLD, the French equivalent. He's also <a href="http://www.floydlandis.com/blog/2007/02/12/198/">4.5 months into recovery from hip replacement surgery</a>.</p>

<p>It seems a small concession from Landis, who has no team contract and can't race until the USADA decision, but his statement specifically rules out any chance he will race in the 2007 Tour de France.</p>

<blockquote>"He understood perfectly that if he didn't act today, we would start the procedure immediately," [AFLD president Pierre] Bordry said. "We will let Landis defend himself as he wishes before the USADA."</blockquote>

<p>The Court of Arbitration of Sport yesterday rejected a final appeal by the UCI to sanction Inigo Landaluze for a postive testosterone case, citing malfeasance by the same lab that in July tested Tour de France winner Floyd Landis.</p>

<p>Inigo Landaluze, who won the 2005 Dauphin&eacute; Lib&eacute;r&eacute; for Euskaltel-Euskadi, was suspended for tests performed during that race. In May 2006, the Spanish cycling federation overturned the suspension (saying it was "not in accordance with all applicable legal requirements"), and the UCI appealed to the CAS.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tas-cas.org/en/medias/media2.htm">Here's the CAS press release</a>, but the nut graf is:</p>

<blockquote>It has been indeed established that the person who conducted the analysis of the B sample was also involved in analysis of the A sample, thus in violation of the international standard applicable to the accredited laboratories. The Panel considered that the violation of this technical direction was likely to affect the results of the analyses. The Panel has considered that the non-compliance with this standard constituted a procedural flaw serious enough to cause the invalidation of the anti-doping test.</blockquote>

<p>That's at the same Labaratoire National de Dopistage du Dopage (LNDD) at Chatenay-Malabry that committed a boatload of procedural errors in the Landis case.</p>

<p>I'll give Floyd himself the last word:</p>

<blockquote>Going through what I am now, I feel personally for Landaluze and hope that everyone recognizes that it has taken him 18 difficult months to clear his name from what was revealed to be a grievous error by the LNDD ... The track record of scientific misconduct at Chatenay-Malabry seems to grow by the day.</blockquote>

<p><A HREF="http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=187035">Tour de France Champion Floyd Landis to Race 2007 Leadville Trail 100</A></p>

<p>According to the linked PR Newswire release, Floyd Landis has accepted an invitation to race at the <a href="http://www.leadvilletrail100.com/index.ihtml">Leadville Trail 100</a>, a 100-mile mountain bike race in Colorado in August 2007.</p>

<p>Landis raced mountain bikes until 1998. His hip resurfacing, in mid-September, went well, and he's been back on the bike, <a href="http://www.dailypeloton.com/displayarticle.asp?pk=10261">including at a charity event on Sunday</a> remembering his father-in-law and five firefighters who died fighting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_Fire">Esperanza fire</a> in October.</p>

<p>Former Tour de France winner <a href="http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20061205/SPORTS/112050046">Lance Armstrong has already committed to the 2007 edition</a> of the race.</p>

<p>If the release is on the level, and Landis hasn't been cleared of pending dope charges and resumed road racing, it would be Landis's first race since the 2006 Tour. </p>

<p>It would certainly pump up interest in the race to have two former Tour winners fighting it out on dirt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goclipless.com/2006/12/floyd_landis_an.html">Go Clipless</a> was one of the first to report this rumor.</p>

<p>Landis and his team have pointed out that the sample Landis provided was labeled 995474. In the report, the lab referred to the tested B sample as number 994474. The Landis team suggests this "has to make you wonder about the accuracy of the work."</p>

<p>The lab, for its part, says the sample tested was Floyd's.</p>

<blockquote>"The error, of an administrative nature, does not mean the positive B sample was not that of the American," Le Monde said. "But it is being used today by his lawyers ... to contest his positive doping results."</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Landis spokesman Michael Henson <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/15/sports/BIKE.php">says no one working for Landis was involved</a> in the hacking of the lab's computers and clumsily forged e-mails questioning the lab's abilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/15/sports/BIKE.php">Henson told Samuel Abt</a>:</p>

<blockquote> "We don't know who would perpetrate this ... We certainly don't know what the source of this incident is.

<p>"We're following the news, but we haven't been contacted by any authorities," Henson continued. "We're not challenging the report, but we need to see details of the investigation."</blockquote><br />

No real news there &mdash; he made the case he's been making in the U.S., but to the French people, and indirectly to the ASO, which will decide whether to strip his 2006 Tour title.</p>

<p>Then, less than 48 hours later, a story appears in <a href="http://www.lequipe.fr/Aussi/20061114_101515_01.html">L'Equipe (in French)</a> (English story linked above) claiming computer systems at the Chatenay-Malabry lab that tested Tour de France samples this year have been hacked. On top of that, L'Equipe claims investigators are focusing on &ldquo;an associate&rdquo; of Landis in the investigation.</p>

<p>The incursion apparently occurred back in September, with e-mails "in poor French" being sent alongside lab documents chosen to make the facility look bad. Lab officials say the documents &ldquo;were taken out of context,&rdquo; which means they're not actually false. The head of the French anti-doping agency took the opportunity to lobby for more tax dollars to better hack-proof the lab's computers.</p>

<p>I suspect there's less story here than initially reported. I can't believe that anyone actually involved in the case would first hack into the system, then send badly forged e-mails that included files garnered by the hacking.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>Embattled 2006 Tour champion Floyd Landis has shared his defense presentation with USA Today, and plans to post more than 300 pages of his defense to <a href="http://www.floydlandis.com/">FloydLandis.com</a> this week (Landis has himself said <a href="http://www.dailypelotonforums.com/main/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1458&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=29824">it will go up on Thursday</a>).</p>

<p>Sal Ruibal of USA Today says the Landis testimony claims the WADA lab test showed inconsistent numbers, with the original number being covered by correction fluid and the number for Landis filled in. This would appear to contravene WADA procedures, which require corrections to be struck through and initialed.</p>

<p>Landis also maintains that only one of four testosterone metabolites were above acceptable levels, and that all four must be to support a positive doping finding.</p>

<p>Final doping results are in form this year's Tour, and 13 riders actually tested positive for one banned substance or another during 19 tests.</p>

<p>Twelve of those riders won't be disciplined because they had &ldquo;Therapeutic Use Exemptions,&rdquo; representing medical permission to use a substance that would otherwise be on the banned list. Phonak's Floyd Landis, who won the Tour, faces suspension and loss of his title as the 13th rider.</p>

<p>The results point up how many riders have exemptions (Landis also had one during this year's Tour, for cortisone, used to treat his decaying hip), and the possibility that at least some of them are not strictly necessary. Out of 105 riders tested at some point during the Tour, 60 percent had a medical exemption for at least one banned substance.</p>

<p>Speaking of Landis, <a href="http://trustbut.blogspot.com/">Trust but Verify</a> is keeping up with almost all the news about his case, and doing a great job of it. You'll also pick up facts like &ldquo;Billiards is the dirtiest of all sports&rdquo; from it.</p>

<h3>Late Late Show host calls Landis "positive for chickensh*t"</h3>


<p>I was just watching Craig Ferguson's opening monologue on the <a href="http://www.cbs.com/latenight/latelate/">CBS Late Late Show</a>.</p>

<p>Ferguson mentioned that Floyd Landis had been scheduled to appear, and gave a rudimentary overview of the current doping case against Landis. &ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;looks like someone tested positive for chickensh*t,&rdquo; which I asterisk-ize because it was bleeped by the network, so maybe he said chickenshot, who knows.</p>

<p>Ferguson pretended to be scooping something up with his fingertip, giving it a smell, holding it up to the light. &ldquo;Yep, that's chickensh*t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The audience ate it up. If Landis had backed out at the last minute, solely because he doesn't want to face the press, I might have considered that a fair shot, but not under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The guy's father-in-law killed himself just Tuesday afternoon. There's probably a lot more important things he needs to take care of right now than the light-night talk shows.</p>

<p>Update: Okay, <i>mea culpa</i>. It was indeed a rerun; I was thrown because a) I hadn't seen it, and b) they led it off with a teaser about coming back after the golf highlights that I thought meant Ferguson was in the studio. Apparently, this was an episode from July 31, and Landis did indeed leave the show high and dry.</p>

<p>Tour de France winner Floyd Landis's father-in-law was found dead in his car Tuesday afternoon, an apparent suicide.</p>

<p>The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that medical examiners are still investigating the cause of death, but initial police reports called it a suicide.</p>

<p>David Witt, 57, who owned a restaurant in San Diego with his wife, was Landis's roommate soon after Landis moved to San Diego. Witt, who shared a coach with Landis, was dating his wife Rose at the time, and introduced Landis to her daughter from a previous marriage, Amber Basile. </p>

<p>Witt and Landis served as best men at each other's weddings.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/08/16/sports/s193418D16.DTL">Coroner's office officials have reported Witt died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.</a> Witt's suicide was probably not a direct result of the doping case against Landis, according to family friend Dwight Van Slyke:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;It could have been a few percentages of the whole maybe, or just another negative thing that he was depressed over,&rdquo; said van Slyke, adding Witt had also been struggling under the strain of opening a new restaurant earlier this year.</blockquote>

<p>Phonak and Astana continue to compete, although Phonak's owner announced yesterday that he'll shutter the team at the end of the year. Astana is being managed by 3 men appointed by Manolo Saiz, whose Active Bay Cycling still owns the team's license, despite efforts by Alexandre Vinokourov and the team's new Kazakh sponsors to buy Saiz out.</p>

<p>With Phonak's Floyd Landis returning a too-high T/E ratio at the Tour, and facing possible revocation of his Tour title, team managers met in Brussels on Wednesday and asked the UCI's License committee to suspend both Phonak and Astana immmediately, with a ruling by Monday.</p>

<p>Of the ProTour's 20 teams, 17 had representatives at the meeting -- all but Phonak, Astana, and AG2R, whose Francisco Mancebo was among the riders held out of this year's Tour.</p>

<p>VeloNews reports that the AIGCP, the International Association of Professional Cycling Groups, also demanded that the UCI reveal all the names implicated in <i>Operaci&oacute;n Puerto</i> by next Tuesday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.floydlandis.com/blog/2006/08/15/181/">FloydLandis.com | An Open Letter to the Phonak Professional Cycling Team</a></p>

<p>Floyd Landis has responded to the end of the Phonak team with an open letter on <a href="http://www.floydlandis.com/">his website</a>.</p>

<p>Landis thanks his team and praises team owner Andy Rihs for his commitment to the squad &ldquo;despite the struggles you've faced in the past.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>While the recent allegations against me hurt us all, I respect the fact that the Phonak team must follow its own rules and charter under these circumstances. I just wish that all the parties involved would do the same. Despite this, I will not relent on my pursuit of the truth. I will not shy away from this fight.

<p>Most of all, I understand that this situation impacts families and friends other than my own. It affects the businesses and sponsors that support cycling as well as the sport itself. It is for this reason that I am determined to show that I followed the rules and won fairly and cleanly. There is a greater integrity at stake here than just my own.</blockquote></p>

<p>The signature? &ldquo;Floyd Landis, 2006 Tour de France Champion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phonak owner Andy Rihs announced today that the Phonak team, dogged by doping case after doping case, will close down at the end of the season.</p>

<p>Rihs, who had brought in John Lelangue and instituted internal testing above and beyond the UCI's standards, said he couldn't find any sponsor willing to support the team, even at a single Swiss franc, or about 80 cents.</p>

<p>Phonak had already announced that it would end its sponsorship at the end of the season, but Rihs had lined up the iShares group of Barclays Bank to take over. Now, with Phonak's Tour winner Floyd Landis facing revocation of his title, iShares has withdrawn from the agreement.</p>

<p>Rihs:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;As a passionate cyclist, I am bitterly disappointed that the sport of cycling apparently has become a synonym for doping.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Rihs has notified the team's riders that they will not have contracts next year, and riders are scrambling to find new teams. Axel Merckx, who had just extended for one final year with Phonak, <a href="http://www.procycling.com/news.aspx?ID=2384">told ProCycling,</a> &ldquo;I want to stick with that decision. If there is a chance I can extend my career I would still like to do one more year.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Doping...Cycling...Pro Cycling...Media...Stupidity</h3>


<p>Joe Baratto, a coach, a Category 1 bike racer, and <a href="http://www.unionbaycycling.com/">fellow teammate</a>, emailed the team about "Doping...Cycling...Pro Cycling...Media...Stupidity," and I'll quote it here</p>

<blockquote>For what's it worth I'll give you my two cents. First and foremost, Floyd did NOT, and I'll put that up again DID NOT test high for Testosterone like the whole fricken world is being lead to believe. His Ratio was high... and seemingly the media has forgotten simple math which states that there could actually be TWO things that make a ratio go up or down. Now Floyd's T/E ratio is high so that means either T (Testosterone) is high relative to E (Epitestosterone) OR the E is LOW relative to the T. Floyd's case is the latter. His testosterone level was completely normal. 

<p>Now what about the isotope thingy? That shows exogenous (from the outside) testosterone. Good question, wish SOMEONE had the correct answer. It is seemly pretty good test but I'm also wondering to what degree are they seeing this? There are NO limits, just the presence of at least ONE Carbon isotope. Out of curiosity, it would be interesting to see the results if they tested ALL the TDF samples with that test. Then we'd see how many others showed this anomaly. The sad thing is people actually doping usually don't get caught since they know if you supplement with Testosterone you also need add some epitestosterone and WATCH your ratio. Most get caught by being careless or stupid. </p>

<p>Now, do I like this, not really, but honestly if anyone believes that's why these guys are pro's (because they dope) they really need a huge reality check. They are pro's because they are GREAT athletes. Period. They work very hard, and are very gifted. A couple years ago some dillweed wrote a stupid article in "Outside" magazine about how he took "the whole deal" EPO, HCG, HGH, Steroids, was medically monitored, given a good training program, and supervision. He made HUGE gains.... Compared to WHAT? He felt incredible, compared to WHAT? He said he could climb better.. compared to WHAT? No times, wattages, or anything concrete was given on his performance gains other then "I felt like superman." Gee isn't that scientific proof at its best. Do drugs work - depends on what is your limiting factors and what drugs you're using.  HGH does nothing for anyone under 40, and then it works on those who are NOT physically active since physically activity causes HGH to be secreted (it's a bit more complicated but for 99% of pro's this does nothing). EPO - well again if your limiting factor is oxygen to the muscles then yes, but for most, the limiting factor is the oxidative capacity of their muscles. </p>

<p>The simple truth is that the highest hematocrit doesn't win the tour, the highest VO2 Max doesn't win the tour, nor does the biggest lung volume or lowest resting heart rate. No ONE factor makes you great. So when friends and family ask about this...cycling is no better OR worse then any other pro sport. Great athletes are great because they are great, NOT BECAUSE OF DRUGS. Weak, pathetic, lazy, people like to think they are tojustify why they aren't Pro's. Bottom line, work fricken hard and you'll get better. How much better... keep working hard and you'll see.  </blockquote> </p>

<p>Joe makes some good points and considering "one carbon isotope," I was shocked by <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/aug06/aug14news3">Pound's screed yesterday</a>. What governing body speaks like that and is accountable to no one? It's that's stupidity of Pound that I hope Floyd fights. Same thing with all of the unproven allegations in Operation Puerto. Careers are ruined, sponsors abandon, years of hard work destroyed all on allegations. If anything is the "year of excrement," as Pound says, it's WADA and irresponsible leadership.</p>

<p>Andy Rihs, who owns the ProTour license for the Phonak team, will address the team's future at a press conference on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Secondary 2006 sponsor iShares had announced plans to take over the team's primary sponsorship, and the entire Tour squad was signed to contract extensions, but that was all before team leader Floyd Landis had a drug test come back with a high testosterone/epitestosterone ratio.</p>

<p>Phonak has fired Landis, but he looks likely to join a long list of Phonak riders who have been sanctioned for doping, a list that includes Tyler Hamilton, Santiago Perez, Oscar Camenzind, and six others in the last 3 years. </p>

<p>QuickStep DS Patrick Lefevere, who is also president of the International Association of Professional Cycling Teams, <a href="http://www.eurosport.com/cycling/tour-de-france/2006/sport_sto941207.shtml">has advocated suing Landis and kicking Phonak out of the ProTour</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.cyclingpost.com/tour/article_003204.shtml">Skoda withdrew from its contract as the primary auto sponsor of the Tour</a>, and it's possible that iShares has informed Rihs that they intend to do likewise.</p>

<p><i>Update: <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/aug06/aug14news">CyclingNews says that's just what has happened</a>, and that Rihs has been unable to find a new sponsor. Their source is reportedly <a href="http://www.blick.ch/sport">Blick magazine</a>, but I can't find the referenced article.</i></p>

<p>Reigning (but for how long) Tour winner Floyd Landis did the media circuit this morning, appearing from Los Angeles with Robin Roberts at ABC's Good Morning America, as well as the Today Show, CNN, ESPN, and CBS.</p>

<p>The first shot of his campaign was an interview with Sal Ruibal, linked above, where Landis claimed the UCI and WADA have been very slow to provide him with information on his positive tests.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I just got the information on the 'A' sample a day and half ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had to find out about the 'B' from reading it in the media.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Landis emphasized to Ruibal and Roberts that he regrets talking to the media immediately, speculating on possible reasons for a test whose actual results he hadn't yet seen:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I've been catching a lot of grief in the press: &lsquo;Floyd has a new excuse, a new reason for what happened.&rsquo; This is a situation where I'm forced to defend myself in the media. It would never have happened if UCI and WADA had followed their own rules,&rdquo; Landis said.

<p>&ldquo;There's some kind of agenda there,&rdquo; he said wearily. &ldquo;I just don't know what it is.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>

<p>Landis has scheduled his hip surgery for about 2 weeks from now, and looks likely to combine recuperation, preparation, and adjudication, as he will face a USADA hearing in the next month or so.</p>

<p>Presumptive 2006 Tour winner Floyd Landis was fired by Phonak today after the test of his B-sample came back positive for a high testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio.</p>

<p>Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour, said &ldquo;It goes without saying that for us Floyd Landis is no longer the winner of the 2006 Tour de France.&rdquo; ASO cannot unilaterally strip Landis of the title, but must wait for the UCI to name Oscar Pereiro the Tour champion, as Denis Menchov inherited the 2005 Vuelta a Espa&ntilde;a title.</p>

<p>Landis repeated his assertions that he is innocent, and that he'll contest the results in any way available:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I will fight these charges with the same determination and intensity that I bring to my training and racing. It is now my goal to clear my name and restore what I worked so hard to achieve.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Phonak offered a <a href="http://www.phonak-cycling.ch/index.php?id=5&amp;L=1&amp;uid=330">short statement</a> outlining the dismissal, and saying Landis's defense is now &ldquo;his personal affair.&rdquo; The team promises a press conference &ldquo;in the next couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I need testerone!</h3>


<p>I rode next to a commuter that was really grinding the pedals over a bridge and he quipped, "I need testerone!" And I said, yeah, "a patch right on your balls!" (referring to the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/austin_murphy/07/27/landis.react/index.html">SI.com article</a>) We both chuckled a bit, but the exchange did indicate the impact of this story and how the Landis story is everywhere. While <a href="http://bikehugger.com/2006/07/what_i_believe_about_cycling.htm">I don't believe anything</a> about pro cycling anymore, I'm relieved to see Landis on the <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=features/2006/landis_larry_king">PR offensive</a>, getting his story out, and he's making a good case. As the story came out, my biggest concern was that we'd have another <a href="http://www.tylerhamilton.com/">Tyler Hamilton</a> story and the ill-fated "I believe Tyler" campaign. Landis has already done well to raise doubt, get support from Lance, bring on the doctors, and it isn't a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/10/health/10bloo.html">confusing chimera defense</a>. </p>

<h3>Landis on Larry King</h3>


<p>Travel day today, so I'll be slow to approve comments, but I wanted to point out a couple of things from Landis on &ldquo;Larry King Live&rdquo; last night.</p>

<p>Maybe we need to come up with a different word than &ldquo;suspended,&rdquo; but it seems to me that if you can't race, and face possible dismissal, you've been suspended. Landis wouldn't cop to that -- he said something like that he had voluntarily stopped racing until this was cleared up -- but I believe UCI regs prohibit him from racing until then.</p>

<p>Landis hadn't yet approved the B-sample test, but he said that was just a matter of trying to work out his options, and to find an appropriate expert to be his representative, and that he expected to notify USA Cyling later Friday night or this morning.</p>

<p>Lance Armstrong called in, and was somewhat supportive, taking the opportunity to note that this is the same lab that tested those infamous samples from 1999. Armstrong says he doesn't think there's any anti-American bias behind the test: &ldquo;I wouldn't say that that's the reason Floyd's going through this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Brent Kay is Landis's doctor, board-certified in sports medicine and internal medicine. He said it's &ldquo;crazy to think a Tour de France rider would be using testosterone in the middle of the race ... It's a joke.&rdquo; <a href="http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=sport&amp;subclass=other&amp;story_id=498190&amp;category=Other&amp;m=7&amp;y=2006">A member of WADA has pretty much said the same thing</a>.</p>

<p>Landis said he was tested 6 times before Stage 17 (I've also heard him say 5 times), but that he isn't provided with results from negative tests, so he's not sure what his TE ratios or other values were on any of those.</p>

<p>Dr. Kay noted that the TE ratio test itself &ldquo;is the original test that was put into effect 25 years ago,&rdquo; and that WADA's website &ldquo;says this is a poor test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looks like the offensive may be working -- the Today show just teased the story without using the word &ldquo;dope&rdquo; (they used &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; instead).</p>

<p>NPR also had a 15-minute interview, which you can download as an MP3:</p>

<h3>Landis speaks: Denies doping</h3>


<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/austin_murphy/07/27/landis.react/index.html">SI.com | Austin Murphy: Landis denies doping allegations</a></p>

<p>Floyd Landis, seemingly the invisible man since the UCI said a rider had tested positive during this year's Tour, has spoken to SI.com's Austin Murphy.</p>

<p>Landis says he's a realist, and &ldquo;can't be hopeful&rdquo; that the B sample will measure differently from the A. Landis says he'll work with Spanish doctor Luis Hernandez, who has defended other riders in high testosterone cases, all successfully.</p>

<p>Landis offers two possible contributors to the positive: the cortisone treatment we've all heard about, and a thyroid condition he says has led him to take a daily dose of thyroid hormone.</p>

<p>I note that, as of 4:36, <a  href="http://www.believefloyd.com/">BelieveFloyd.com</a> has been registered and parked. CafePress t-shirts can't be far behind.</p>

<h3>Landis reaction from around the web</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frank_steele/133291370/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/45/133291370_46b538c632_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="8" alt="Man of the hour" /></a><p><a href="http://www.salon.com/sports/col/kaufman/2006/07/27/thursday/">King Kaufman's Sports Daily | Tour de France shocker</a></p></p>

<p>Salon's daily sports columnist King Kaufman quotes John Eustis, interviewed on ESPN's Dan Patrick show, and noting that every rider who has contested the testosterone test has prevailed. Eustis also claimed that Landis's testosterone levels were low, but the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone was above 4:1, the new &ldquo;positive&rdquo; level this year.</p>

<p>Cortisone use (approved for use on Landis's hip) can reportedly raise testosterone levels, as can alcohol.</p>

<p>BBC Sport talked to Greg Lemond, who's apparently not in the &ldquo;wait for the b-sample&rdquo; crowd:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I'm devastated and extremely disapointed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can't imagine the disappointment for Floyd and his family. I really did believe Floyd was clean.

<p>&#8221;The problem is the sport is corrupt and it corrupts everybody. I still believe it was one of the cleanest Tours ever. But is it 100 percent clean? No.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will always find riders who transgress the laws. I really did believe Floyd was not among them, that he was clean. Hopefully, he will be able to tell the truth.&#8221; </blockquote></p>

<h3>Landis over threshold for testosterone at Tour</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/jul06/jul27news3">CyclingNews.com | Phonak confirms Landis positive</a></p>

<p>The Phonak team confirms that their Tour de France champion Floyd Landis is the rider whose A-sample tested positive.</p>

<p>Intense speculation had focused on Landis, after it was announced that the test was taken after Stage 17, his epic breakaway to Morzine. Contrary to a couple of reports, the test was positive not for stimulants, but for a too-high ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phonak-cycling.ch/">team website is unresponsive</a>, but CyclingNews quotes a statement by the team:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;The team management and the rider were both totally surprised of this physiological result.

<p>&#8221;The rider will ask in the upcoming days for the counter analysis to prove either that this result is coming from a natural process or that this is resulting from a mistake in the confirmation. In application of the Pro Tour Ethical Code, the rider will not race anymore until this problem is totally clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the result of the B sample analysis confirms the result of the A sample, the rider will be dismissed and will then pass the corresponding endocrinological examinations.&#8221; </blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/jul06/jul02news2">Spanish investigators allege that testosterone patches were commonly prescribed</a> by Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes, at the center of the <i>Operaci&#243;n Puerto</i> investigation.</p>

<h2>July 26, 2006</h2>



<a id="a0011880070"></a>
<h3>More on positive Tour rider</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,28910-2287959,00.html">TimesOnline | New drugs revelation set to rock Tour to its foundations</a></p>

<p>Jeremy Whittle reports for the Times of London that the rider who tested positive at the Tour is a &#8220;high-profile rider&#8221; who tested above the allowed threshold for testosterone, and did so after Stage 17, the stage to Morzine won by Floyd Landis after his 130-kilometer breakaway.</p>

<p>Whittle quotes UCI president Pat McQuaid, who refused to name the rider:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I will say that I am extremely angry and feel very let down by this,&#8221; McQuaid said. &#8220;The credibility of the sport is at stake. The rider, his federation and his team have been informed of the situation.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>The Tour organization performs daily tests for the stage winner (Landis), the race leader (Oscar Pereiro on that day), and a random selection of 6-8 riders. Additionally, 2-3 teams are sometimes chosen randomly to be tested before a day's stage, but this positive is apparently a post-stage sample.</p>

<p>How many riders could put &#8220;the credibility of the sport&#8221; at stake? Landis, of course, Pereiro probably, Kl&#246;den I suppose -- he did make the podium, and precious few others.</p>

<p>Landis reportedly skipped a scheduled criterium appearance Wednesday; Whittle notes this and that neither Landis nor director Lelangue could be reached for comment, but says nothing about Pereiro.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.projo.com/biking/content/projo_20060727_27tour.33b43b2.html">the Providence Journal has an AP story</a> that says that, while the UCI said the rider's national federation has been notified, USA Cycling spokesman Andy Lee said the organization has not been contacted, while the US Anti-Doping Agency's spokeswoman offered a &#8220;no comment.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Update 7/27 8 a.m.</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.procycling.com/news.aspx?ID=2341">Procycling quotes Danish newspaper <i>Ekstra Bladet</i></a> that the product involved was a stimulant, and that the federations for the US, France, Spain, and Italy have all denied the rider is registered with them. CSC has also said it was not one of their riders.</p>

<p>The organizer of the Acht van Chaam criterium in Holland, upset that Landis pulled out of the event without an explanation, has been unable to reach Landis or Phonak manager Lelangue.</p>

<p><b>Update 7/27 9:45 a.m.</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/10590.0.html">VeloNews offers a good summary</a>, adding that AFP has reported that the German federation was not contacted, excluding Kl&#246;den, and that Landis is scheduled to appear on <i>The Tonight Show</i> on Friday.</p>

<p>Also, I neglected a quote from Pat McQuaid mentioned in the Procycling story above: TuttoBiciWeb, an Italian website <a href="http://www.tuttobiciweb.com/home.htm">quotes the UCI president calling it &#8220;The worst scenario possible&#8221;</a> (actually <i>il peggior scenario possibile</i>, since the site's in Italian).</p>

<p>The incredible comeback ride by Floyd Landis during Stage 17 also brought back OLN's drooping ratings.</p>

<p>Live viewership of Stage 17 was 77 percent higher than the battle on l'Alpe d'Huez the previous day. Overall viewership on the day rose 50 percent to 1.3 million for the day.</p>

<p>Through the balance of the race, the numbers stayed up, with viewership among men in three key demographics up by more than 90 percent.</p>

<p>The 2005 Tour, Lance Armstrong's last, averaged 1.6 million combined viewers per day, with <a href="http://www.tdfblog.com/2005/07/sunday_tour_cov.html">an OLN-record 1.7 million tuning in for live coverage of the race's final stage</a>.</p>

<h3>Armstrong: &#8220;We would take Floyd back&#8221;</h3>


<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/more/specials/tour_de_france/2006/07/23/lance.discovery.landis.ap/index.html">SI.com | Armstrong impressed with Landis' effort</a></p>

<p>Seven-time Tour winner Lance Armstrong said Sunday he was impressed by Floyd Landis' Tour victory, and that Discovery would like to sign the Phonak captain:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;We've always been interested in Floyd, he's a damn good rider,&#8221; Armstrong said Sunday. &#8220;We would take Floyd back. We've pursued him for some time now.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, Landis doesn't want to go back to Discovery. I think he would be concerned about going back into Armstrong's shadow. Even retired, Armstrong is everywhere, making pronouncements to reporters from the top of l'Alpe d'Huez and the Hotel Crillon, publicly mending fences with Jean-Marie Leblanc, riding RAGBRAI, hosting the ESPYs.</p>

<p>I think that tactically, Discovery would have provided better support than Phonak for Landis, but I also suspect that if Landis stays with the team, iShares will want to protect their investment by signing a few strong support riders to bolster the returning Phonak squad.</p>

<p>Armstrong from Saturday:</p>

<blockquote>His ride on Thursday was epic. He showed a champion's resolve. I look forward to seeing him up on the podium in Paris. If it couldn't be one of my guys from Discovery Channel, th[e]n I am thrilled to see Floyd continue the success of American cycling.</blockquote>

<p>Samuel Abt profiles Wim Vansevenant and Jimmy Casper, the Stage 1 winner who has twice been the <i>lanterne rouge</i>, or last-placed rider in the Tour. The two were head-to-head yesterday, as Vansevenant finished 11:26 back, in 131st, but Casper topped (bottomed?) him, 138th at 13:37, closing the gap to only 16 seconds.</p>

<p>Vansevenant got some bonus time at the day's second sprint, but he still managed to finish 138th (out of 139) today, losing another 1:54 on the day to cement his hold on the 2006 Tour's <i>lanterne rouge</i>.</p>

<p>Vansevenant finished 4:02:01 behind Floyd Landis. </p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Lanterne rouge is not a position you go for,&#8221; Vansevenant said. &#8220;It comes for you.&#8221;</blockquote>

<h3>Hushovd adds Paris to Strasbourg; Landis triumphs</h3>


<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/5207952.stm"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41921000/jpg/_41921768_podium416.jpg" height="225" width="312" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="8" alt="Two lions top the podium"></a>A late escape attempt by Discovery Channel may have overcooked Robbie McEwen, as Credit Agricole's Thor Hushovd easily outsprinted Davitamon-Lotto's sprint king to take the final stage of the 2006 Tour de France. CSC's Stuart O'Grady, recovering from a fractured spine suffered early in the race, took 3rd on the day.</p>

<p>Hushovd completed an unusual set of bookends, <a href="http://www.tdfblog.com/2006/07/hushovd_takes_2.html">winning the Prologue time trial</a> 3 weeks ago yesterday and now taking the final stage into Paris.</p>

<p>Floyd Landis stayed near the front early and stayed out of the dicey sprint at the end to nail down his first-ever Tour de France victory, finishing 69th on the day, 8 seconds behind Hushovd. It's the 8th straight US win of the race, after Lance Armstrong's 7 consecutive wins.</p>

<p>McEwen can take some solace from his 3rd green jersey win, resulting from his 3 stage wins.</p>

<p>Michael Rasmussen's <a href="http://www.tdfblog.com/2006/07/rasmussen_takes.html">tremendous breakaway win to La Toussuire</a>, overshadowed by Landis's attack the following day, shot him to the lead, and the overall win, in the climber's polka-dot jersey competition.</p>

<p>Damiano Cunego, already a winner of the Giro d'Italia, takes the best young rider's white jersey, just 38 seconds ahead of Marcus Fothen of Gerolsteiner. The pair were about 90 <i>minutes</i> ahead of the next competitor in the under-25 competition.</p>

<p>Saunier Duval's David de la Fuente, the climbing jersey leader until Rasmussen's big day out front, takes the overall &#8220;most combative rider&#8221; prize.</p>

<p>Landis took his final yellow jersey of the Tour with his daughter Ryan on the podium.</p>

<p>Post-race interview with Frankie Andreu: Landis says, &#8220;Right now, I have no intention of switching teams.&#8221; Leaves a little wiggle room, but sounds like the iShares team (as Phonak will be called next year) has its Tour captain for 2007.</p>

<h3>Stage 20 on the road</h3>


<p>For the first and only time this Tour, OLN's “Pre-Race Coverage” actually starts before today's stage.

There are two 4th-Category “climbs” on the day, but they'll have no impact on the climber's jersey race, which will be won by Rabobank's Michael Rasmussen.

Similarly, there are two intermediate sprint lines and bonus points at the stage finish, but they'll have no impact on the sprinter's jersey race, to be won for a 3rd time by Davitamon-Lotto's Robbie McEwen.

French champion Florent Brard of Caisse d'Epargne couldn't start this morning after breaking his hand during yesterday's time trial. Robbie Hunter of Phonak also doesn't start, as he finished outside the time limit yesterday. That means 139 riders start Stage 19.

<img vspace="8" hspace="10" height="129" align="left" alt="Landis sips champagne in yellow" src="http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20060723/thumb.82fad7f31df245eb9dc04558fb7277af.cycling_tour_de_france_tdf101.jpg" />As retiring Tour director Jean-Marie LeBlanc signals the end of the neutral zone, Landis and Pereiro ride side-by-side. White jersey Damiano Cunego rides just behind, next to Viatcheslav Ekimov, today finishing his 15th Tour de France. Fifteen starts, fifteen finishes.

Robbie McEwen in the green jersey rides at the field's left front with Michael Rasmussen.

Photos all around, as riders <em>and</em> the journalists get photos of all the jersey leaders. Landis poses with the obligatory flute of champagne, Phonak poses stretched across the road in front of the field, and riders chat peacefully in the peloton.

<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/photo?slug=getty-cycling-tdf2006-landis-cunego-rasmussen-mcewen_10_28_15_am&amp;prov=getty"><img width="130" vspace="8" hspace="10" height="93" align="right" alt="The 4 jerseys" src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/sp/getty/thumb.getty-cycling-tdf2006-landis-cunego-rasmussen-mcewen_10_28_15_am.jpg" /></a>With 110 kilometers to ride, Michael Rasmussen comes to the head of the Phonak parade, and leads the field over the day's first little climb, to increase his polka-dot jersey lead. He's got 166 points, while Landis teammates Moerenhout and Grabsch are 2nd and 3rd.

Some idiot is standing in the middle of the road; the riders smoothly split and go around, but that's the sort of thing that can quickly change the face of the Tour.

At the second 4th-Category climb, it's Victor Hugo Peña of Phonak ahead of CSC's Fränk Schleck and Caisse d'Epargne's David Arroyo. With that, the climbing competition is over: Rasmussen 166, Landis 131, David de la Fuente 113.

As they approach the first sprint line of the day, Robbie McEwen rides out of the pack on teammate and <em>lanterne rouge</em> Wim Vansevenant's wheel. As they near the line, McEwen pulls alongside, and pushes Vansevenant across the line first. Then McEwen, then Victor Hugo Peña, leading the peloton at the head of the Phonak team.

Vansevenant picks up 6 bonus seconds, narrowing the battle for the last-placed rider: he's now only 10 seconds behind Jimmy Caspar of Cofidis.

The pace is picking up, and Phonak is leading the peloton to the Champs-Elysees for the 1st circuit.

Discovery Channel's Viatcheslav Ekimov comes to the front and leads the field to the Place de la Concorde, in recognition of his 15th Tour finish. <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/shared-gen/ap/Other_Sports/CYC_Tour_de_France_Ekimov.html">He's ridden 36,000 miles in the Tour alone</a>.

Eki goes back into the field, and quickly we have our first attack; Bouyges Telecom's Walter Beneteau, pursued by Carlos da Cruz, and quickly absorbed. Next it's a Euskaltel, Aitor Hernandez, and he's got 50 meters. Hernandez leads at the close of the first lap, and is captured.

Commesso is off the front with a Saunier Duval, David Millar, who is right in the gutter, 4 inches from the curb. They can't get a good gap and are recaptured.

Cunego has flatted! He's off the back. If he loses 36 seconds, he'll lose the white jersey, and he's soloing back. 

<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/photo?slug=getty-cycling-tdf2006-landis_11_25_26_am&amp;prov=getty"><img width="97" vspace="8" hspace="10" height="130" align="right" alt="Landis on the Champs-Elysees" src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/sp/getty/thumb.getty-cycling-tdf2006-landis_11_25_26_am.jpg" /></a>Jens Voigt has attacked off the front, with Fabian Wegmann and Mikel Astarloza; Wegmann leads Astaloza and Voigt over the sprint line.

They're caught, but not by the peloton, by about 5 other riders. If they form a group, It's a strong one. Horner is hear, a Discovery -- looks like Popovych -- is here, Johann van Summeren is here. Horner and Van Summeren are disrupting the break as well as they can. Philippe Gilbert, Garcia-Acosta, Reuben Lobato, Christian Knees, are there. Bothcarov, Albasini, and Da Cruz are chasing to the escapees.

Cunego is back on the rear of the peloton.

Liquigas and Cofidis have missed the move, and they're powering hard at the front of the field, 20 seconds behind the 15-rider break. It was as much as 40 seconds. Gilbert attacks out of the escape, and Chris Horner jumps onto his wheel. They now lead the other escapees by 50+ meters. They're reintegrated.

Gerolsteiner's Sebastian Lang flats with 3 laps to ride, and it takes a long time to get a wheel change.

Six riders Millar, Astarloza, Chris Horner, Christophe Mengin, Vincente Garcia-Acosta and David Millar lead the race, but are only 9 seconds ahead of the peloton. The rest of that break are back in the field. Padrnos is in a 5-man group chasing, and it's been gobbled by the Liquigas and Cofidis-led pack.

As they come through the <em>flamme rouge</em> for 2 laps to go, Astarloza raises the pace, and his breakmates match it, but the field is breathing down their neck.

They're captured. Landis is right at the front as they take a 180-degree turn.

Française des Jeux leads the pack, and now Davitamon-Lotto comes forward. Discovery is coming up the right side of the pack <em>en masse</em> as they come to the beginning of the final lap of the day.

Gonzales of Agritubel is gone up the left side; 1 lap, 6.8 kilometers, less than 4 miles to race. Three DVL riders, a QuickStep and an FDJ push the pace at the front, and Gonzales is reabsorbed.

Jens Voigt takes a little dig, but nothing doing.

With a half-lap, Flecha tries to go, gets 5 meters, and here comes Ekimov! He's riding them off his wheel. Schleck is behind him; Hincapie and Popovych are just behind. Hincapie and Popovych are off the front!

Popovych goes super hard. He's countered by a Liquigas and Calzati. Popovych drops off and the sprinters are coming forward, with 400 meters to go. Zabel follows McEwen, Hushovd goes hard , and Thor Hushovd takes the Prologue and the final stage of the 2006 Tour de France!

Incredible sprint by Hushovd, getting maybe 5 meters on McEwen, who takes the green jersey. Floyd Landis finishes safely in the field, and completed his amazing 2006 Tour victory.</p>
