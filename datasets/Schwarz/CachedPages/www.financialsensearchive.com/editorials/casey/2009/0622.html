              <p class="text">              I bet you don&rsquo;t own enough gold. <br>
              <br>
                Before you tell me I&rsquo;m wrong, let me ask it this way...</p>
              <ul type="disc" class="text">
                <li>If       inflation returns, or even hyperinflation... </li>
                <li>If       the economic crisis persists and gets worse... </li>
                <li>If       uncertainty and fear continue, and chaos and rioting begin... </li>
                <li>If       stock markets languish or suffer another meltdown... </li>
                <li>If       the recovery spending of the world&rsquo;s governments proves futile...&nbsp; </li>
                <li>If       government interference in the economy continues to increase... </li>
                <li>If       the value of the U.S. dollar takes a major fall... </li>
                <li>If       world recovery from the current recession/depression takes years... </li>
                <li>If       you&rsquo;re still wondering whether you have enough &ldquo;safe&rdquo; money... </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text">...would  you feel you own enough gold? <br>
              <br>
              If all those things come to pass, I suspect many of us, including myself, would  wish we had a few extra gold coins or bars stashed away. <br>
              <br>
              So let&rsquo;s assume you answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; to my question and need to add some ounces to  your collection... is now a good time to buy?<br>
              <br>
                <strong>The Best Time to Buy Gold?</strong><br>
              <br>
              Before glancing at the chart below, if you had to pick the month with the  weakest average gold price, which would you select?<br><br>
              <img width="624" height="427" src="http://www.financialsensearchive.com/editorials/casey/2009/images/0622_clip_image002.jpg" alt="JuneHasBeentheWeakestMonthforGold.jpg"> <br>
              <br>
              In our current 8-year bull market, June has seen the lowest return for gold. In  other words, it&rsquo;s been, on average, one of the best times to buy. <br>
              <br>
              How does this compare to the bull market of the 1970s? <br>
              <br>
              <img border="0" width="624" height="427" src="http://www.financialsensearchive.com/editorials/casey/2009/images/0622_clip_image004.jpg" alt="SummerWasGoodBuyingTimeinLastBullMarket.jpg"> <br>
              <br>
              In the last great bull market, summer also was a good time to buy gold  (although April was even better.) <br>
              <br>
              What about gold stocks?<br>
              <br>
              <img width="624" height="453" src="http://www.financialsensearchive.com/editorials/casey/2009/images/0622_clip_image006.jpg" alt="JulyandOctoberHaveBeenBestTimestoBuyGoldStocks.jpg"> <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Since 2001, July and October have been the weakest months for gold stocks, as  measured by the AMEX Gold Bugs Index, and the best times to buy. <br>
              <br>
              However, keep in mind that these are price tendencies and not certainties.  There were Junes when gold was up, and some Julys when gold stocks were up.  Meaning, avoid using this chart for trading purposes or in anticipation of an  immediate gain. Instead, use it to prepare for possible gold price weakness  ahead. And if the weakness shows up, treat it as a buying opportunity and add  to your holdings to position yourself for the next leg up in the bull market.  Consider that this summer could be the last chance to buy gold for three  figures.<br>
              <br>
              Don&rsquo;t lose sight of where we are at this point in the recession &ndash; in an  intermission in the bad economic news. When it becomes apparent that the good  ole days aren&rsquo;t coming back, sentiment &ndash; and markets &ndash; could move rapidly. And  gold is one of the best forms of capital that can protect you in a financial  Armageddon. That gold was up in 2008 is a reminder of its protective power. <br>
              <br>
              How much gold should you have? Continue to accumulate physical gold until you  can honestly say you don&rsquo;t care how many dollars Ben Bernanke prints. &nbsp;</p>
              <p class="text">Having physical gold in your possession is always a good  idea in times of economic turmoil &ndash; there is no &ldquo;uncertainty hedge&rdquo; like it.  But to actually <em>make</em> money, you  should also look at premium gold stocks. Our current favorite has been so  consistently successful that we call it &ldquo;48 Karat Gold.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/crpmkt/crpSolo.php?id=146&amp;ppref=FSO146ED0609A" target="_blank">Click  here to learn more</a>. </p>
