              have never been a fan of investing in gold.  Commodity investing 
              has always been difficult.  Gold is a commodity with political overlays.  
              As an asset gold does not pay interest or dividends.  Interest and 
              dividends, whether reinvested by the investor or the company, are 
              an important source of compounding and compounding is crucial to 
              building long term wealth.  Gold does not generate a positive cash 
              flow.  In fact, it consumes money.  The owner of gold must store 
              it and insure it.  Not only does storing gold cost money it, but 
              it also presents a real problem if the investor has very much.  
              Gold bars should not be stored in your basement next to the food 
              storage.  Burglars may not break into your house to steal your wheat 
              and water, but they will steal your gold.</span></font></p>

              being in the doldrums for twenty years, gold has been moving up 
              in price.  This chart shows the great run up in gold price that 
              peaked at 880 in March of 1980.  That spike was followed quickly 
              by a collapse.  Its price then drifted sideways and down to about 
              250.  It has been rising rather steadily ever since early 2001.  
              This is attracting attention, and some are wondering if it is time 
              to consider buying gold.  Even though I have never been a fan of 
              gold investing there are some valid things to think about.</span></font></p>

"Times New Roman"'>Gold as an Inflation Hedge</span></font></h1>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Inflation 
              has been mild in the </span><st1:country-region><span style='
  font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:country-region><span style='
font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> for many years.  Now inflation seems to 
              be creeping in.  It is important to remind ourselves what inflation 
              is and where it comes from.  Inflation can be viewed in two ways.  
              Either the value of things is rising in terms of paper dollars or 
              the value of paper dollars is falling relative to the value of things 
              to be purchased.  This can be an important difference.</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>The 
              value of paper money can go down if the government is printing too 
              much money.  Money creation in the </span><st1:country-region><span
  style='font-family:Arial;
  "Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> is handled by the Federal Reserve.  
              Despite the well publicized government deficits to date, the </span><span style='
 font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>FED</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> seems to be handling the money supply 
              well.  The interest rate increases of the past year and a half are 
              part of an effort to keep the value of the U S dollar from falling.</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Inflation 
              can also occur if the value of important resources rises relative 
              to the value of paper money.  Oil is the culprit this time.  It 
              has been rising dramatically in price.  Oil is an important resource.  
              It goes far beyond just gasoline.  Oil is a feedstock in many types 
              of materials.  That means that increases in the price of oil must 
              eventually be reflected in increased prices for everything from 
              plastics to airline tickets. </span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Oil 
              is a commodity, a worldwide commodity.  That means it is subject 
              to rules of supply and demand.  By now nearly all informed citizens 
              are aware that oil supplies have not been rising as rapidly as demand 
              in recent years.  This has been due to an expanding economy in the 
              </span><st1:country-region><span style='
  font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:country-region><span style='

  style='font-family:Arial;
  "Times New Roman"'>China</span></st1:country-region><span

  style='font-family:Arial;
  "Times New Roman"'>India</span></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>.  Additionally, we have been reminded 
              that refining capacity in the </span><st1:country-region><span
  style='font-family:Arial;
  "Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> is extremely tight.  There hasnt 
              been a new refinery built in 20 years in the </span><st1:country-region><span
  style='font-family:Arial;
  "Times New Roman"'>U.S.</span></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> </span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>On 
              top of this, capacity has been temporarily affected by the hurricanes 
              in the Gulf.  Now with the price of oil jumping, concern about inflation 
              is rising (no pun intended).  The storm-related problems are temporary; 
              fundamental problems will take longer to resolve.  But they will 
              be resolved.  That is one of the characteristics of a commodity.  
              Rising prices attract additional supply and reduced demand.  Eventually 
              the market stabilizes.  (Incidentally, it is just silly to believe 
              that high oil prices are due to a monopolistic conspiracy on the 
              part of large oil companies.  Even a cursory understanding of the 
              enormously complex world oil markets will dispel this all-too-popular 
              myth.)</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>The 
              first question for investors looking at gold as an inflation hedge 
              becomes, is there going to be a period of high inflation where the 
              price of nearly everything rises?  Or are we experiencing inflation 
              in a single but very important commodity?  If it is a general inflation, 
              gold will almost certainly be a good hedge because it is a commodity 
              and will hold its value while the value of paper money declines.</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Whether 
              there is general inflation is still an open question.  We do know 
              that oil is rising in price. The next question, then, is will gold 
              be a good hedge against the rising price of oil?  Gold has historically 
              been a good hedge against oil.  And it has been thus far in this 
              cycle.  However, there is no direct connection between these two 
              commodities.  </span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>For 
              example, almost no oil is used in the mining or refining of gold 
              or vice versa.  High oil prices do mean that a lot of dollars, euros, 
              yen and other paper currencies are pouring into oil producing countries 
              and in some cases the pockets of wealthy royal families.  Historically, 
              a portion of those paper currencies has gone to buy gold.</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Finally, 
              if an investor were to conclude that gold is a good hedge against 
              oil inflation, is that investor willing to bet that the price of 
              oil will continue to climb?  If the price of oil has already peaked 
              with the hurricane disasters, will the price of gold settle back? 
              Then if gold is a hedge for oil is the price of oil at a peak, or 
              will it continue to rise?  </span></font></p>

              we are a very long way from failure, and as awful as some of these 
              things are there is little indication the government is about to 
              collapse and its currency become worthless.  For example, we are 
              not yet experiencing anything even as bad as what the country went 
              through in the 70s and early 80s and we survived that.  What we 
              are going through is not that bad yet!  Maybe its coming. If you 
              think it is, buy gold.  (Incidentally, I have read the prophecies.  
              A lot of terrible things are going to happen.  Spiritual gold will 
              probably be more important than physical gold during those times.)</span></font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>The 
              two previous sections imply that the only reason to invest in gold 
              is if an investor is expecting that bad things such as inflation 
              or anarchy are going to happen.  In fact, gold is an important metal 
              with everyday natural uses in manufacturing, medicine, jewelry and 
              other areas.  Some analysts indicate that for years the demand for 
              gold has outstripped the mined supply of gold by 60% or more.  Some 
              of this deficit has been made up by central banks selling portions 
              of their gold reserves on the world markets.  Hard numbers are difficult 
              to come by.  However, the persistent rise in the price of gold since 
              the spring of 2001 suggests a shortage does exist.</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Higher 
              prices will eventually result in more supply being made available.  
              I know of no study suggesting that all the gold on the planet has 
              been found and dug up.</span></font></p>
            <h1><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;
"Times New Roman"'>How to Invest in Gold</span></font></h1>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>As 
              I indicated in the beginning, I am not a big fan of investing in 
              gold.  Personally, I especially dislike the idea of owning actual 
              gold bullion or coins.  If your major concern is that the government 
              will collapse, then you have little choice but to hold the metal 
              itself.  However, if an investor would like to invest in gold as 
              a hedge against inflation, or international tensions or as supply/demand 
              play I recommend using a mutual fund that specializes in gold.  
              A simple web search will bring up a list of potential funds to research 
              and consider.  Additionally, there are gold mining companies that 
              are publicly traded.  If gold continues to rise, so will they.</span></font></p>
            <h1><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span style='
font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Do Not</span></i><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> 
              Speculate</span></font></h1>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>One 
              thing you definitely should not do is this:  Do not get caught up 
              in a speculative frenzy.  Look at the chart at the top.  See that 
              spike in 1980 </span><span style='font-family:Arial'></span><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'> 
              that took gold to almost $900 an ounce.  If you think this chart 
              looks a lot like a chart of Internet stocks in 2000, you are right.  
              Both represented massive speculative bubbles.  Many investors poured 
              money in with the idea that things could never end.  I believe we 
              are a long way from a speculative bubble in gold right now.  But 
              for those who know nothing about it investing in gold, now could 
              be just as speculative as 1980.  Study the market; know what your 
              objectives are and what events will cause them to be realized.</span></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>Gold 
              has a lot of valuable uses.  In my opinion the most important use 
              of all time was its use to preserve the spiritual records of a great 
              nation.  Fortunately, no ones ever been allowed to make any money 
              of that.  But if you feel you need gold as a hedge against difficult 
              times, may I suggest that before you fill your basement with South 
              African Krugerrands you follow the counsel of the Brethren and fill 
              your basement with food storage.  In the end, gold is just one more 
              thing thats hard to take care of, hard to hold to and one more 
              thing you cant take with you.</span></font></p>
