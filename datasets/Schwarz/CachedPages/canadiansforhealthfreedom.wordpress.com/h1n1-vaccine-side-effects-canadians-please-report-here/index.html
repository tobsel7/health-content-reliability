<p>Since the GSK H1N1 vaccine was rolled out in late October, many people are reporting  adverse side-effects from the shot.   These reports are not being publicized, largely because there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone collecting them.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to collect some data of our own, and created this page to find out what sort of damages are really being done by the flu shot.  You are invited to participate, and help others decide for themselves whether or not to accept a flu shot.</p>
<p>If you have experienced any adverse reactions or &#8220;side effects&#8221; with the vaccine, please share your personal stories with us and other Canadians, IF they are &#8220;first hand&#8221; (personal), or &#8220;second hand&#8221; (provided that you are close to the person affected, were a witness, and can vouch for the authenticity).</p>
<p>Anything that is &#8220;third hand&#8221; (rumors) should NOT be included, UNLESS it is something you are actively checking into, to verify it.</p>
<p>If you find media reports, you may post excerpts with the pertinent details, so long as you also include a link to the report (assuming it is posted on line). If it is from a source without a web presence, such as a local paper, be sure to include full details (Title, date, city, etc).</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>Simply use the reply field below. You do NOT need to include your full name (or real name) if you choose not to, BUT you must include a real e-mail address in case we need to get back to you for any more details.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT TO REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>Please be sure to to include as much detail as possible, such as <strong>where</strong> (city or at least your home province) and <strong>when</strong> the vaccination was administered, and whether it was the regular GSK Arepanrix H1N1 vaccination (adjuvanted), or the version they are offering to pregnant women (non-adjuvanted &#8220;Panrix&#8221;), and what you experienced.</p>
<p>Please supply your <strong>gender, approximate age, and general health condition prior to vaccination</strong>, as well as a <strong>description of symptoms you experienced</strong>, and for how long.   A list of side effects you might expect, from the package insert of Arepanrix (adjuvanted) vaccine, is below, to help you assess whether or not your symptoms are likely associated with your vaccination.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Your report will not appear immediately as comments are moderated. We check several times per day for new comments. Please be patient.</p>
<p>If we receive sufficient responses, we will publish articles on this occasionally based upon the reports and data we receive.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help with this project!</p>

					<p>I will start this off. This is not &#8220;firsthand&#8221; info, but I think it is worth noting. </p>
<p>I received this on 11/08/09 at about 10 PM PST) from a friend, a young lady who is in hospital in or near Toronto area. She is pregnant but she is NOT in the hospital due to the flu. She is unable to post this herself right now.</p>
<p>&#8221; i heard some of the nurses and staff talking today about kids who have gotten the h1n1 shot&#8230;.i think a boy under or just 2 died from the shot (I will ask around for confirmation), and a lot of kids have gotten really sick from the shot, some kids have gotten swine flu from the shot. i talked to 4 people today that got the shot and got really super sick. i&#8217;ve been here since thursday&#8230;i went to my OB&#8217;s clinic and they are giving out shots to pregnant women in the clinic, and the place was packed. they have tried to vax me 3 times but i have refused!&#8221;</p>

					<p>Hi all&#8230;I had the H1N1 vacine and seasonal flu shot on December 8th.  On December 11th, I started to get a headache which turned into a severe, nauseating, almost debilitating migraine that that has lasted since then. </p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t occur to me until last night when I was trying to think of what could trigger such horrible headaches, but I could think of nothing&#8230;except the H1N1 flu shot.  The headaches were so bad that my doctor sent me for a CAT Scan (no results yet as my doctor is away until January 4th).  My vision has been affected, extreme sensitivity to light and noise.  I&#8217;ve had have the lights dimmed in my office and put a glare screen on my computer just to be able to work. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been &#8220;living&#8221; on Advil and even took Tylenol with codeine last night just to be able to function.  Today seemed like a good day until a few hours ago&#8230;</p>
<p>I have no basis to prove it was the flu shot, but that is absolutely the only &#8220;new&#8221; thing in my life.  I&#8217;ve identified with similar posts here.</p>
<p>I regret taking the H1N1 shot.  I&#8217;m 53, female, and in excellent physical health&#8230;except these headaches.  I can only hope they go away soon!  ):  </p>
<p>If the CAT Scan shows anything different, I&#8217;ll let folks know &#8211; but I really believe it was the shot after reading posts on this site.</p>

					<p>Hi just noticed your post as im trying to inform myself why my wife who has never suffered from headaches is now almost immobilezed with severe migranes everyday she has been prescribed strong codine with no help her doctors says that these migranes can be trigged by a virus which besides the fact they started after her h1n1 VACCINE makes me conclude it was the vaccine that started them.  My quest now is how to stop them</p>

					<p>I received the vaccine in mid-November. Pain in my right arm began the next day but subsided within 48 hours. Immediately after that, I began to experience pain in my right pelvis area. That pain extended down the thigh, into the right knee and down my right shin. I am still having all of this pain and we are now into January. I am not sure which of the vaccines I received but if I have to, it&#8217;s easy enough for me to find out. I&#8217;m just now starting to get concerned with this because it&#8217;s affecting how comfortably I perform my job which includes carrying a large case and using the TTC multiple times throughout the day.</p>

					<p>I got the shot on Dec 10th, and since Christmas time am experiencing dry eyes, dry lips and some tingling in feet and hand off and on&#8230;&#8230;.anyone felt like this? Hope it goes away and does not result into a serious autoimmune disorder. I don&#8217;t want to think about it ..but can&#8217;t help it. Squalene is responsible for GWS.</p>
<p>Is anyone monitoring the side effects after 2 weeks? That is when the Antibodies develop and potentially the autoimmune diseases symptoms kick in.<br />
Focus is on the immediate adverse reactions. Please someone, get the message out,  there are greater risks after the two week period. The shot might develop antibodies that attack our body instead of protecting us.</p>
<p>Why is the government allowing this vaccination program to carry on. The Adjuvant -SQUALENE is the killer.</p>

					<p>Yes I experienced the tingl,ing of the feet.  I had the H1N1 shot in late November.  December of course was busy and I had no time to notice anything different BUT the first week of January I suddenly became ill with what I thought was a flu.  Everything ached, I was listless, could hold my head up for a few minutes is all, could not even lift my feet to walk (just shuffled forward).  Well after 2 weeks and no improvement my husband called the doctor&#8217;s office and the nurse said go to Emergency.  Being female (stubborn) I decided to hold out and surely I would feel better soon.  Well at the end of the 3rd week I agreed to go to Emerg.  The doctor took blood for testing and the result was that the meds I have taken for 45+ years which were steady in my blood in October before the regular flu shots and H1N1 shots in November suddenly spiked to a toxic level.  I have had no other thought but that he H1N1 injection had something to do with the imbalance.  My dilantin level had maintained at 63 (40-80 is therapeutic) and now was 105.   With great hesitation I cut my dilantin dose in half and over a 4 week period I have maintained it now at 44 which is at the lower end of the therapeutic scale BUT I am afraid.  I have not driven a car for 3 months as I just do not feel safe to do so.  It certainly has changed my lifestyle.</p>
<p>To summarize, if you have been taking any medication for a long period of time and have had the H1N1 injection do get your levels checked not just today but in a few weeks.  I go every week now.</p>

					<p>I got the h1n1 vaccine shot in november 2009 and probably two or three weeks after that I got quite severe itchy scalp with some hives on the scalp as well. Since I am not allergic to anything, I am quite sure that it is one of the possible side effects. I am a senior 75 years old of good health&#8230;. (edited)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />
I have also had a severe itch following the vaccination. My scalp and eyelids especially. I am only 30, but I have been trying to figure out how this could have happened. After tracing my paths, I have discovered that this must be a reaction to the vaccine. I have never felt so awful. Please share your cure with me if possible.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

					<p>Just an update&#8230; I contacted the attorney Sisiki (can not find spelling). I explained that I was a member on this discussion. After explaining my symptoms, the response was that there is no class action formed against this vaccine, but the attorney&#8217;s office would contact me again if that changes. So, for now it seems that we are stuck with our symptoms. Hopefully someone will step up to fight for us on this. I wish wellness for everyone.</p>

					<p>CTV News, Nov. 4th, 2009 &#8211; A Quebec woman died after she had received the H1N1 vaccination on Oct. 29th.  Two days later, she came down with symptoms of the flu, then died. CTV, however, reports that she died of  &#8220;complications resulting from the H1N1 virus.&#8221;  It seems, however, that that is just an assumption.<br />

					<p>Here in Red Deer 2 of our Co-workers have experienced large redness around the injection site- one has a large welt.This rashy redness is lasting days<br />
Another co-worker and her daughter got very sick just short of 1 day after being vaccinated.<br />
what are you seeing?</p>
<p>All the information I have is heresay and second party info.  I will share it with you anyway.</p>
<p>A couple I know got the vaccine in Lacombe with their 1 year old daughter.  They reported a woman having a reaction to the vaccine (immediate) in the line-up ahead of them, severe enough to have paramedics called.</p>
<p>The other experience I&#8217;ve had has been on the Advocate posting forum &#8211; anonymous poster so absolutely not verifiable &#8211; but she reported a sore arm &#8211; burning sore &#8211; that needed several Tylenol.  A day passed and she reported a severe headache, still sore arm and that she felt &#8220;awful&#8221;.  She reported that she&#8217;d spent that entire day in bed.</p>
<p>Sorry, both second-hand info.  No one I know closely has gotten a shot.</p>
<p>also&#8230;</p>
<p>****  was at a TD bank today and one of the tellers told her that her friend&#8217;s 4 yr.old son is in hosp, paralyzed from the neck down, following his flu shot. </p>
<p>The doctor reassured the mother he would recover in about 4 months !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Rec&#8217;d an e-mail from a Chiro in Edm. who said his friend&#8217;s 5 yr old had a flu shot at kindergarten and started having seizures within seconds following.<br />
The rest of the children and teachers were so upset , traumatized watching him , that they all went home for the day.  He was taken to hospital by ambulance.</p>
<p>and<br />
Just recd. a phone call that a nursing student here in RD was sent home from clinical practicum because she refused the flu shots.</p>
<p>The nursing school said they signed a contract with AB Health Services.  Who are these people?  The Medical Mafia ??</p>
<p>also&#8230;<br />
a fellow student of mine who works in a doctors office said they are reporting everything as H1N1 because it is too early in the year for the seasonal flu.</p>

					<p>More vaccine adverse reactions&#8230;and<br />
reactions to the virus itself.</p>
<p>a friend of mine today shared that her daughters friend ( a teenager) had taken the vax, and that same day she was bathing and became instantly ill&#8230;<br />
she felt light headed to the point of passing out, couldn&#8217;t communicate, managed to get her house coat on, head spinning and got down stairs opened the front door so she could yell out for help because she didn&#8217;t know what was happening to her. she passed out at the door.</p>
<p>and this from a friend&#8230;</p>
<p>I am not getting the flu shot, not this one, not the regular one, but my son&#8217;s girlfriend did get the shot and has been sick for two weeks with , guess what?  the flu from hell!</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, my neighbors daughter has a friend in Sundre, young guy, 24 ish, got sick and within two days was sent to a Calgary hospital.  He did not get the shot.</p>
<p>I as well have caught what ever virus it is that is floating around and cannot get over how extremely tired, achey and lifeless it leaves you feeling. The part I hated the most was the brain fog and depression. I am finding that many many people are reporting the tiredness and brain fog- inability to concentrate once their body is fighting this virus<br />
Another family member of mine who is also fighting this virus felt so heavy she was not able to pick herself up out of bed. And the extreme tiredness and lack of appetite.<br />
this virus seems to lay dormant for a few days, and just when you think you are over it, boom back comes the fever, headache and extreme tiredness again.</p>
<p>what have they but in this bio- weapon??</p>
<p>Again- I would rather get the virus and fight it off naturally than take the virus in the VAX shot along with everything else they &#8216;claim&#8217; is in the shot and who knows what else!</p>

					<p>Laura, I cannot give you medical advice, but what I would do in your position is investigate a product called MMS at  <a href="http://www.miraclemineral.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miraclemineral.org</a> .  This is an incredibly powerful cleansing agent, which binds particularly well to toxic metals.  You can read about it on the site. I think you&#8217;ll find it a tremendous help and it is very inexpensive, being a simple natural mineral.  Do investigate.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to check out the story of Desiree Jennings, the cheerleader who was literally devastated by the vaccine.  She is making a great recovery from a state of being completely incapacitated, via the treatment of an osteopath who is using chelation therapy and cleansing supplements.  Google the Doctor&#8217;s name, the story is on his site&#8230;. it&#8217;s Doctor K. Buttar.</p>
<p>As for is there going to be any treatment, if you mean from the medical community, we doubt that much would be offered except symptom-squelching drugs, which would be an even greater toxic load on your body.  Before you go there, check out what the naturopathic world has to offer.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, for your comfort, a hot soak in an Epsom-salt bath (use about a cup in a full tub) with some lavender oil drizzled into it would be a wonderful soother, and I bet you need one.  Stay as warm as possible: your body needs to relax as deeply as possible.  Drink lots of fluoride-free water.  If you find it difficult to drink, take many small sips.  Add some lemon juice to the water to alkalize your system.  You could also drink two glasses daily of pure water with about 10 drops of 35% Hydrogen Peroxide (food grade only! available at organic/health food/natural remedy stores.  This will oxygenate your blood and kill a lot of pathogens in your system.  There are many, many ways to clean, nourish and maintain our bodies, and they will help you.</p>
<p>While I highly recommend MMS as a product which cleanses toxic garbage out of the system regardless of the state of their health, I would really recommend that you see an osteopath, in order that it may be determined what effects have occurred and how to best remediate them.</p>
<p>But the bath?  Absolutely!</p>
<p>Please report these symptoms to your own doctor, or to public health as an &#8220;ADVERSE EVENT&#8221;.  Normally only 10% of adverse events are reported, and people need to know the truth.  Also, even if you feel better, and return to your normal schedule, be on the lookout for any abnormalities in how you feel. We hope not, but residual effects could follow.</p>
<p>Wishing you renewed health,<br />
Dee Nicholson</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />
I&#8217;m in Cornwall Ontario, have heard a couple of friends and their children coming down with the flu after only a few short hours of having the H1N1 vaccine, and have heard of several others neighbors and friends on my facebook that have said they were very ill after receiving the shot, including high fevers, the flu, major of their arm, grogginess. and in bed for a few days etc.</p>
<p>Also I was told by a friend who was visiting a Cornwall nursing home that he overheard nurses speaking and that they were saying of their residents had went crippled from the H1N1 vaccine!</p>
<p>also from listening to Dr. Paul from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit on 1220 AM on the radio show someone asks him if anyone would take responsibility if any side effects should happen from this shot…. surprisingly the answer was NO! he said when taking the shot, he was pretty sure there was a liability waiver with this vaccine? Meaning an informed consent if you take the shot then you’ve already agreed that you will take responsibility for yourself if anything happens to you,YOU are NOT covered….. listen to #9 ………… <a href="http://www.am1220.ca/news/h1n1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.am1220.ca/news/h1n1/</a></p>
<p>Something definitely wrong here!</p>

					<p>I am also from Ontario and was in the medical field for a few years. I&#8217;ve noticed that the medical field is split on this vaccine, with half the doctors saying they will not take this vaccine. Also some that are saying they will take it are NOT? Why is that?</p>
<p>Have heard of two different neighbors saying their kids and themselves have been very ill after receiving the flu shot. </p>
<p>Also went out to breakfast yesterday morning with my friend. We were talking about the vaccine and our waitress commented about what we were talking about. She told us that one of her regulars were in that past weekend and had slurred speech badly, her customer said she only started having this the day after the flu shot. Very scary!</p>
<p>Also if you read this <a href="http://whathappenedtohealth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://whathappenedtohealth.blogspot.com/</a> &#8230;.. you will notice that they will be (the media) announcing the death of a 6 month old baby soon, where they will be blaming it on Crib death, when its only days after the child got vaccinated&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>also on that same link you will be able to find countless pages of info on the vaccine itself and the vaccine leaflet pamphlet  that is carried with the vaccine&#8230;. why is the Health Unit not handing out these leaflets? they ONLY hand out a little paper saying that you could get fevers, chills, nausea etc. but NONE of the other things from the leaflet are on this little piece of paper&#8230; TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS</p>

					<p>My boyfriend got the H1N1 vaccine in one arm and the seasonal one in the other just over a week ago. He was really tired afterward and slept for approximately 4 hours, was tired most of the next day too. His arm that he had the H1N1 vaccination in was so sore for about 4 days, the first two days he could barely lift it up. He also developed a cough that lasted for a few days as well.</p>

					<p>I saw a post from a &#8220;friend of a friend&#8221; on Facebook &#8211; apparently the woman, who lives in Montreal said she had a reaction severe enough that she was brought to the hospital by ambulance this past Friday night. I sent her a message requesting the details, and this is what she wrote back:<br />
**************************************<br />
I had my shot along with my husband and kids on Friday night at about 6pm about 5 minutes after I felt really weird, my head was felt very spacy and dizzy. I felt like I was going to throw up and I had a weird tingaling feeling going right through my body. The had me lie down and put ice on my head and put my feet up but I felt worse. They gave me some orange juice because I hadn&#8217;t eaten since lunch. I then started to tremour and shake really badly and couldn&#8217;t stop so they called an ambulance and then went to emergency. 2 days later I am still feeling really weak and dizzy it is even difficult for me to type on the computer. I hope this helps and let me know if you need more info. Because of this I will never take or give my kids another flu vaccine.</p>

					<p>I experienced the exact same symptoms as this woman.  I had my shot on Friday evening as well, and they had to call my husband to come and pick me up from the clinic due to nausea, tingling hands, feet and face as well as feeling like I was going to faint.  I felt sick all weekend, and missed work yesterday.  I am at work today, but still feel very weak and am experiencing strange sensations in my hands and feet.<br />
I am telling everyone not to get this shot.  If you are the woman who had this experience, I would appreciate hearing from you to see how you&#8217;re feeling now.  This is so scary!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am from Toronto, Canada. I had the H1n1 non adjuvanted vaccine on Tuesday Nov 10 when I was 4 1/2 weeks pregnant. On Wednesday, i started spotting and on Thursday I was bleeding heavily. I have lost my baby. I know in my heart the vaccine is to blame because I do not have a history of miscarriages, and I have had 2 full term pregnancies. What I am most concerned with now is, is there a chance I could be infertile? As I understand not even that is known to be a side effect of the vaccine. I want answers. I want an apology from the Canadian government for the loss I have suffered because they recommended all high risk people get vaccinated, and I followed their instruction. Where do I go from here?&#8221;</p>

					<p>Sandy, words cannot express how angry and upset for you we are, that you, and many others, are suffering in this way.  We have heard numerous reports of miscarriages in the USA, and their unadjuvanted shot is nearly identical to our own, if not the same.  Your case exemplifies the reason why we are all in this fight.  Nobody should be so callously uninformed about what is going into their bodies, for what purpose, and what effect it is likely to have; everyone deserves to be able to read and understand the package insert, so that no-one can minimize, or obfuscate, the possible side-effects.</p>
<p>Is there a chance you could be infertile?  I wish I could say no, don&#8217;t worry, your problems are over, but only time will tell.  Meanwhile you need to ensure that you get as much of that toxin out of your system as possible.  The unadjuvanted shot contains ten times the mercury of the adjuvanted one, so you have toxic metal damage to deal with and it must be removed.  There are naturopathic methods of cleansing metals (a couple are listed above in other responses, though we cannot give medical advice&#8230; we can only tell you what WE would do in your circumstance, friend to friend.) Chelation and supplementation worked for Desiree Jennings&#8230; google Dr. K Buttar for her story. Her side effects were different, but treatment remains pretty much the same.</p>
<p>What we can tell you is that there is  treatment to remove mercury and other metals.  You will not find it in the conventional medical community, which chokes up every time somebody screams it&#8217;s their fault, then lies through its teeth to cover their butts.  You&#8217;re in Toronto?  So am I, and there are a number of good people here who will ensure you get the right stuff.  You have to look for them.  There is a doctor by the name of Gannage in Markham who comes highly recommended&#8230; he has a website and is easy to find.  Otherwise look for an osteopath/naturopath/clinical nutritionist who knows their stuff. This city has lots of them.  You can find many through Vitality Magazine, which is free.</p>
<p>As for complaining to the government, first of all, all complaints of adverse events in Canada are supposed to go through doctors&#8230; which we feel is horrendously inadequate and unreliable.  Doctors are usually the first people informed, but as a norm, they deny everything connected to vaccines, so in general only about 10% of the adverse events are reported. But you can see from the figures in the article at the top that they EXPECT these things.  They just don&#8217;t let on to the average person that the one in a hundred (out of a million vaccinated, that is TEN THOUSAND  PEOPLE!!) &#8220;rare&#8221; side effects could easily affect YOU!   So you need to make a formal complaint through your doctor, ensuring that he or she WILL report it.  </p>
<p>Then, because the Canadian government has guaranteed the indemnification of the vaccine companies, you need to write to your Member of  Parliament and demand to know the process by which compensation for your injury can be applied for.  Don&#8217;t be silent about it.  It is our silence and compliance which allows these things to carry on and affect other Canadians, but if we speak out, say NO, and legally come after those who damage us, make them take responsibility, we can have an effect.  My feeling is that you would qualify for major compensation, not just an apology.  But you never get what you do not demand.</p>
<p>We wish you the very best, Sandy, along with our profound condolences on your loss.  If we can help by pointing you to information or ideas that may be of assistance, please let us know.</p>

					<p>I received adjuvant vaccine. 3 days later, developed rt side back pain with tingling in feet. Tingling has persisted mostly on feet up to calves, sometimes on hands. After the tingling, sometimes have a tight, weak feeling in the calf/foot muscles. This is now Day 16 post vaccination. Symptoms are no better but do wax and wane, most often they are present. Have reported this to Public Health and have seen a specialist but can get no reassurance or prognosis. They don&#8217;t know if it is temporary or permanent and can offer no advice. They just don&#8217;t know enough about this vaccine.<br />
Have spent every day worrying about Guillain Barre and whether this is permanent.</p>

					<p>So sorry to hear of the neurological problems you&#8217;re experiencing. Although you can&#8217;t take the vaccine back, do read Dr. Russell Blaylock&#8217;s article entitled&#8230;. &#8220;What to do if you have to take the vaccine.&#8221;  (not sure if I got the title right)  Most of the info alludes to what to do prior to taking the shot.  However, there is some additional info that may prove useful.  </p>
<p>What makes me furious is that I challenged local radio etc. repeatedly to have on voices critical of the H1N1 vaccine, but, of course, they&#8217;d only endorse voices from monopoly medicine.  If there had been some semblance of objectivity concerning the &#8216;roll out&#8217; of this vaccine, many people would not have been duped into unnecessarily taking it and risking serious long-term effects. The media deserved to be blasted for their steadfast refusal to take an independent, critical look at GSK&#8217;s shot. They are complicit in the damage that many are now suffering, and many more will suffer in the future as most vaccine reactions play out long-term. </p>
<p>Maria, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re keeping a record of how things are going day to day.  Be sure, to complain and report what you&#8217;ve been going through not only to the medical &#8220;authorities&#8221; but local and national media who falsely report that there are few reactions.  Vaccine safety is basically a policy of don&#8217;t look, don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t find &#8230;. It&#8217;s appalling!</p>
<p>(<strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:</strong> Again, we ask for restraint and brevity here. This page is intended for people to post their adverse reactions, not rants. Sympathy is assured here! A few supportive words, tips and links are welcome, but please be brief! We also welcome original articles as separate posts)</p>

					<p>My daughter had the vaccine, and about 10 minutes later she got extremely thirsty and panicky.  Then she suddenly felt very ill and nauseus and tried throwing up.  She suddenly went pale ( I mean white from head to toe, her arms were white), we were told to take her to lie down on the mat, and by the time we were walking to the mat her skin turned green! I mean absolutely green, I didn&#8217;t even know that someone could turn green! Her arms were green too, and especially around her lips. I was so scared!! She also complained of feeling very sweaty. It took her awhile to get her color back to normal, she had a headache after and was extremely tired. I am anti-vaccine now for sure, my son will not be getting his second dose!!</p>

					<p>Wendy, a word of caution here:<br />
Firstly, you will want to ensure that your child is taken to an osteopathic physician immediately, to institute cleansing procedures.  Chelation and supplementation therapies tailored to the patient&#8217;s needs are what they generally use to reverse such damage.  Meanwhile, carefully monitor her condition.  Take a look at all the symptoms in the reactions list above.  Your daughter likely went white, nauseous and shocky because of a sudden drop in blood pressure&#8230; a very serious reaction that could have had much more serious results, including her death.  She clearly had an allergic episode.  Do treat it seriously. If I were you, I would contact her doctor, and ensure (and I MEAN ensure) that he makes a report on this.  Less than 10% of all adverse events are normally reported. This one should be.</p>
<p>All the best to the little one for a complete and speedy recovery!  Remember, a little knowledge is your best friend&#8230;.</p>

					<p>I am a 39 year old healthy female with no underlying health conditions and was feeling fine.  I received the adjuvanted H1N1 shot on the afternoon of October 25/09 in Ottawa.  I have had a reaction to the regular flu shot in the past so I do not get them; so I expected a reaction to this one as well.  The reaction was much worse than I expected.  By 9pm that evening I could barely move my arm it was so sore; I also felt a bit anxious and shaky.  By 12:30 at night, I was sweaty and shaky and had a fever of 38.8 and lay awake unable to sleep till about 3:30 am.  By the morning, I couldn&#8217;t lift my arm and my hand/wrist was swollen and I still had a fever&#8230;I took Tylenol and spent the day at home resting.  I had wicked chills and my skin was crawling and I still had a fever.  By the next morning, my fever had dropped to 37.5 and I started to feel better.  It took a week to feel mostly back to normal.  I then developed a really bad cold and sinus infection with a cough too so went to the doctor.  Asked about the reaction to the shot and was told that likely I am allergic to one of the preservatives in the shot.  Not a happy camper at all as I sat on the fence for awhile and tried to educate myself as best as I could before getting the shot.  My husband had the shot and only suffered a bit of a sore arm.  My 4.5 year old had the shot, was irritable and had a low grade fever but no other complaints.  We were told that the kids would likely not need the second dose of the vaccine.  Regardless, I won&#8217;t be taking my son back for the second dose.</p>

					<p>On November 15, 2009 &#8211; Health authorities across Canada, tossed out (where) hundreds of doses (500 doses, just in Toronto) of the swine flu vaccine…because of miscalculations…over how many time-sensitive doses were needed. </p>
<p>The typical shelf life for the GlaxoSmithKline AREPANRIX™ H1N1 made for Canada is: 18 months of stability for the Antigen Suspension and, 3 years of stability for the Adjuvant Emulsion.</p>
<p>Mixing the two components is quite simple…the complete contents of the adjuvant vial is withdrawn and put into the antigen vial…shake well…and you have 10 doses ready to go. Once the two components are mixed…the dose is only good for 24 hours (hmmmm).</p>
<p>This probably meant that several hundred, perhaps thousands, of syringes and needles were also tossed out due to poor planning. </p>
<p>November 17, 2009 &#8211; Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&#8217;s chief medical officer said; adverse reactions data to the H1N1 vaccine, of which, the vast majority were mild cases; fever, sore arms and allergic reactions, will soon be made available on the Public Health Agency of Canada website. The reactions have also included one death, potentially from anaphylaxis, he said. All adverse reactions were linked to the version of the vaccine containing Adjuvant.</p>
<p>David Jensen, a spokesman for the Ontario health ministry said; there have been 346 adverse events associated with the H1N1 vaccine in the province.</p>

					<p>This is so interesting to read &#8211; I&#8217;m glad I found it after reading the article in the Georgia Straight. I never had any intention of getting the shot for myself but have been going back and forth about getting it for my 2 and a half year old. Every time I tell someone that I don&#8217;t want her to have it, they look at me as if I am the worst mother in the world &#8211; how could you expose your child to H1N1, they ask&#8230;&#8230;???? I was almost at the point of giving in and taking her to get it, but after reading this and other articles about the risks of the shot, I am glad I haven&#8217;t. Thanks!!!!!!!</p>

					<p><strong>Just a quick update: </strong> health authorities have called for the withdrawal of 170,000 (higher risk) doses of the vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline. The initiative, of which the importance is being downplayed, is said to have come from the manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, which expressed concern on higher than normal adverse reactions to the vaccine. Full story here:  <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=16192" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=16192</a></p>
<p><strong>We cannot stress enough how important it is for those who have had adverse reactions to voice them publicly.</strong> You should report them to your doctor too, of course, but please realize that that Health Canada and PHAC are in a conflict of interest situation, as they (feds)  have absolved GSK of ALL liability and have accepted the liability for damages on behalf of Canadians. In other words, we are all paying for the shots, and the damages too, so it is not in their interest to acknowledge or to disclose the full extent of adverse reactions, as it will reflect badly on them. So PLEASE &#8230;put it on public record so that we have a better overall picture of the situation and can challenge their public statements, and hopefully, all victims will have a better chance at receiving compensation.</p>

					<p>My son is with the 2010 games security force.  He was given the vaccine a couple of weeks ago and has come down with some kind of lung infection.  He has never had any kind of respiritory issues before.  He is healthy and 21 years old.  As he is deployed, I haven&#8217;t had the chance to research his diagnosis or medications, but I sure want him to see our GP, ASAP.  I hope to book him in when he&#8217;s on leave.</p>

					<p>I am glad I had the vaccine, but I had a bad night two nights later and symptoms are continuing<br />
My wife who had vaccination at the same time has had no similiar reaction. I am in my mid eighties.<br />
I woke mid night with a very sore aching right hand. By morning I realized that my entire body was also affected, but not to the same amount. I have the general sense of unease of a mild case of flu. The hand may have been worse because of arthritis and is sore to pressure, but usable for light use.<br />
The injection site was never sore and I had the regular flu shot several weeks ago.<br />
After reading above site comments I think my reactions are probably the result of the injection.</p>

					<p>My two boys had the shot and they both had different reactions.  The first one had difficulty breathing about 4 hours after&#8230;&#8230;but is fine now.   My second son had diminished reflex ability in the arm that he got the needle in but it developed a week  later.  It would shake when he extended it and would be in great pain.  Did anyone one else experience that?  I too had the shot and had a sore arm and it was soar to lift but i think everyone had that. His arm is almost able to extend fully now but it still shakes.  Would I get the shot if i were to do it all again. NO WAY! There should have been way more testing on it.  We are their lab rats.</p>

					<p>I got the shot 5 weeks ago.  The shot did not hurt, and was fine the first day.  2nd day my arm was sore, and I said to myself &#8220;Oh, that is because of my shot yesterday&#8221;, the next day it was worse.  For the last 5 weeks I have limited use of my left arm and it throbs.  If I massage it, it seems to make it even worse.    </p>
<p>I dont know if I would ever get the H1N1 again.   I get the regular flu shot every year, without a problem!</p>

					<p>Got the H1N1 first week in Dec. The pain is still there and arm use is limited. I  was told the shot if given too high ( into cartilage ) , would take up to two mths. to heal and it has been nearly three. I am tired of sleeping with ice packs but damp heat makes it worse. I seldom sleep more yhan 3-4 hours at a time than the pain wakes me up. Any suggestions.</p>

					<p>I am 46 and female.  I received theH1N1 flu shot in October in a small northern Saskatchewan community.  The arm that I received the needle in was sore for about two weeks.  I forgot all about it.  There were quite a few people in our community who had similar reactions, ranging from mild, to moderate.  It didn&#8217;t seem like anything to worry about.  It seemed better than getthing H1N1.  My son-in-law didn&#8217;t receive the vaccine and he was in the hospital for over 6 weeks and almost died.  He was on life support for a month, so a sore arm, didn&#8217;t seem to be to worrisome.<br />
Sometime in December, I reached over to pick something up and my arm &#8220;pulled&#8221; like a strain or a sprain.  This kept happening.  It is now the end of February and my arm is partially mobile.  I cannot lift my arm over my head or even up to shoulder height.  I do not have the strength in that arm as I do in the other one.  it is swollen and I have tingling fingers.  I have been to the doctor three times, have had prednisone shots and anti-inflammatory shots.  Nothing has stopped the pain.  It is sometimes so bad, I feel like vomiting and I do have tears in my eyes from the pain if I move that arm suddenly.<br />
I am scheduled for time with a physiotherapist to get some of the mobility back.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what the beginning of all the pain was, until I starting thinking back to the vaccine and how sore my arm was afterwards.<br />
I thought I would do some research on side affects and came across this site.  It makes sense now.<br />
I just don&#8217;t know what to do about it, are the doctors here going to believe me or even investigate a possible connection betweent he H1N1 vaccine and the problems I am having with my arm?<br />
What can be done to take the pain away and strengthen the arm?<br />
How exactly can the vaccine have that adverse an effect?</p>

					<p>I am 57 and had the H1N1.  Sore injection site for about 10 days.  About 1 month later went to raise my left arm above my head to do some work and felt like a knife being pushed into the injection site.  This pain is localized to the injection site.  It is now 3 1/2 months later and no change so am going to Physio and as an aside have felt lethargic since the shot.</p>

					<p>I would like to comment on Nicole&#8217;s story:<br />
I have the same issue, the doctors and myself have no idea what caused this, but after reading your notes, it;s pretty consistent with mine. I have had several anti-inflamatories, pain killers, muscle relaxers, and still living with this and not really improving. I am now on Lirica, have the doctors told you that you had a C5 &amp; C6 impingement? This does not surprise me. I didnt want to get the vaccination, but the health nurse convinced me that the there was more mercury in a can of tuna, than the H1N1 dose, so I did it and regretful from the minute it was done. I knew better, and I should have never have gotten it  or allowed my 11 year old to get it.</p>

					<p>hi everyone, im 21 years old and I got the H1N1 shot on friday morning. Ive been on the fence about this shot for a few weeks but finally decided that I did not want to be a carrier and just to go for it. </p>
<p>About 5-10 minutes after the shot I fainted, but they let me go half an hour later when my blood pressure was back to normal. immediately i started to worry i was having severe allergic reactions or signs of GBS. About 2 hours later at work I started to get tingling sensations in my right leg (I got the shot in my left arm), and I started to worry. It is now about 30 hours post shot and i just came home from work because i had a panick attack that i was getting GBS. My right arm started to tingle a while ago, and i have what seems like a big lump in my throat (ive been crying so maybe its from crying). Currently my legs are tingling and i am a giant stressball. </p>
<p>I have found other forums and many others have had similiar sensations. I dont know if i should go to the ER right away but i am terrified I will develop GBS. its causing me great anxiety. I am going to book an appt with my neurologist on monday but i cant stand this stress. people keep telling me to stop worrying but its so hard not to worry. i will keep everyone posted. i hope this goes away and i can be normal again. I feel like Ive been worrying straight for a month, first I worried about catching the h1N1 virus, then I worried about side effects from the h1n1 shot, and now that ive got the shot Im worried about GBS.</p>

					<p>Yes, Maja, you should definitely see a doctor right away and insist that this be reported to the Ministry. Don&#8217;t let anyone play it down. After you have done that, please check out the links for Dr. Blaylock, Dr. Eisenstein, Dr. Deagle and some others we have posted, who have written detox protocols.

					<p>I recieved an injection of the H1N1 adjunvented vaccine today at a hospital clinic in Ottawa, around 12:20 pm. After the injection, I received and took the 2 tylenol I was given and waited the reuired 15 minutes. When I returned home, I was so fatigued that I slept most of the afternoon, although my plan had been to go to the gym and workout.<br />
I also had a mild headache which lasted only a short while. I noticed this the first time I awoke from my afternoon sleep in a chair.<br />
Around 6 pm I began to feel ill and shortly afterwards had two bouts of diarrhea.<br />
The injection site feels fine and I am once again beginning to feel tired. I will go to bed ealy in the hope that I can get up tomorrow morning and go to work.<br />
For the last five yeas or so, I have taken the annual flu shot and have never had a reaction. (I have an allergy to cow-milk products which I understand is NOT in the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

					<p>Hi, Got the H1N1 shot on Friday  Nov 20th around 5:30 and had sat down for the mandatory 15 min period, I&#8217;d say about 7 or 8 minutes I had a &#8216;stoned&#8217; feeling and everthing was weird and confusing and the next thing  it felt like I waking up out of  an anaesthetic, muffled hearing and felt droggy, and eventually coming back to my regular self.<br />
 I reported to the attending personel of the symptoms and they took all my info and kept asking if I was ok, and the weird thing was I felt more energetic after all that had happened, maybe I was still kind of stoned, that was why I felt so good?<br />
 Mind you I work very hard during the day and I may have been dehydrated and had not eaten for 5 hours.<br />
 It&#8217;s been two days now and I can not raise my arm over my head and it is quite sore right know!</p>

					<p>I had the regular H1N1 vaccination on Monday, November 16th in the morning.  I was fine until about 1:00 in the morning (now Tuesday).  I awoke with severe stomach pains and diarhea.  This lasted until Saturday &#8211; off and on.  On Tuesday afternoon, I suddenly felt very exhausted and then started coughing, had a headache, a fever, muscle achiness and just felt basically rotten.  Here it is now Sunday evening, and I am still not feeling great.  My stomach pains are gone, but all the rest remains, although not as bad as a couple of days ago.  My fever is lower than before (it was usually around 38.6 &#8211; 39), but still comes and goes.</p>
<p>My arm has been sore most of the week, but nothing I couldn&#8217;t handle until last night.  The pain has really increased and now there is a red spot where the injection site was.  My whole arm is sore now and very difficult to lift and extremely sore if I role on it while laying down (which is something I must do a lot of right now).</p>
<p>Hopefully all this will be gone soon.</p>

					<p>I am in a degree that shares a lot of courses with nursing students. I noticed after they had their shots (it was, take it or fail your course/degree) the absenteeism in those classes went up quite a lot. I&#8217;d say about half the students disappeared for a few weeks. As well, one of them said about a week after the shot she started having serious insomnia. I think she also said, a month later, her arm was stil very sore. Another person I talked to said his wife is a nurse and she mentioned tonnes of kids who got the shot were passing out and vomiting.</p>

					<p>I had my seasonal flu shot as well as the H1N1 shot early Wednesday Morning.  I then developed a fever that afternoon, (expected and not surprised) I woke up Thursday morning at 4:00 am with hives on my face and ears, along with swelling.  I&#8217;ve never had a reaction to any shots before.  I went to the hospital, they gave me some steroid drugs and other allergy pills.  That evening it continued with a fever, untill Friday morning (two days after the shot) I woke up with huge hives, and welts all over my body!  It was horrible! I went back to the hospital, but nothing could be done. It lasted untill 7:00 pm I thought I was going to rip my skin off.  Since then (its Monday now) I&#8217;ve felt feverish, and chills, I missed two days of work, and barely made it back today.  Definately not fun!</p>

					<p>Dear annab, you are having a sustained allergic reaction to the shot and should see a doctor immediately to report this. The fact it&#8217;s lasted this long means it should be officially counted as an ADVERSE EVENT.   But do a little reading on this page before you decide on treatment&#8230; there is a lot of information here to follow up on.  It is not likely that your doctor would recommend chelation detox and supplementation with nutritional supplements, but we do recommend that you investigate further before choosing your course of treatment.</p>
<p>In the interim, you might find some relief in a hot bath with Epsom Salts (it&#8217;s a natural detoxifier) and baking soda (very soothing on bug bites, sunburn, etc. as well).  Use a half cup of each, add a few drops of your favorite essential oils, and enjoy.</p>
<p>Wishing you a quick return to the best of health.</p>

					<p>I got the H1N1 shot eight days ago on  Nov 16th.  I was very apprehensive but since I work in the emergency services sector, they offered immunization without the long line-ups, it seemed almost everyone was going so I joined the majority.  That night, my arm was so sore, I couldn&#8217;t sleep, it felt like someone lit a line drive into my upper arm without exaggeration.  I haven&#8217;t felt well since&#8230;weak, tired, just not myself.  I&#8217;m getting worried because my arm is still so sore that I try not to use it.  I&#8217;m living on Ibruprofen and thinking that I made a huge mistake getting this thing.  If I could take it back, I would.</p>

					<p>I got the shot a week ago tonight, Nov. 17th at 7:45pm. Within a minute or two I felt severe nausea and dizziness, and preceded to faint. The nurses at the clinic were helpful and  once they got my feet up I came to&#8230;the next series of events is hard to explain as I lay weak on the floor I was told my blood pressure was incredibly low and they feared I was having a serious allergic reaction. They gave me a major adrenaline shot to get my pulse up (it worked&#8211;too well). The next thing I knew I was in an ambulance on my way to emergency with a suspected heart attack. I am 40 and very healthy&#8211;a serious runner. To cut the story short&#8211;the hospital spent the next 6 hours seeing if I did have a heart attack (EKGs, CT Scans). I didn&#8217;t, the senior cardiologist said it was likely a major fainting episode brought on by the allergy or an anxiety attack&#8230;.I wish this was the end of the story. Since I was released, I missed 3 days of work with severe tiredness and head grogginess. Each day I would go through 3 or 4 &#8220;bad patches&#8221; where I felt I was about as hungover as I ever have been. I have been monitoring my fever and i have yet to have one. This is weird as I do feel like I have the flu. In essence I feel uneasy about everything for a while and then my head clears and I feel &#8220;normal&#8221; for a while (usually at night). I had a good day yesterday with only 15 minutes of a bad patch, then today felt wiped out and fuzzy almost all day. </p>
<p>I wish I knew how long this would last or how to flush my body. I have found doing a daily walk has helped clear my head, as has drinking a lot of water and eating (even if not hungry).</p>
<p>I should note my little 2-yr old girl got it with no symptoms, which is perplexing.</p>

					<p>Hi Paul,<br />
I had my shot on November 13 and within 5 minutes experienced nausea, dizziness, tingling in my hands, feet and face  and came close to fainting.  I also felt quite ill for about 4 days and then it started to subside.  All of last week, I had the same feeling of uneasiness/anxietty/fogginess that you describe.  I&#8217;ve also continued to have the tingling in my arms and legs on and off.  I am feeling somewhat better this week, with less tingling sensations and more muscle cramping.   The fresh air does seem to help as well as the water.  This whole experience has been horrible and I am hoping that there are no long term effects from the reaction.  I am curious as to whether or not you&#8217;ve experienced the tingling arms/legs as well.  Also, I haven&#8217;t been sleeping well since the shot.   Last night was better, I actually slept 7 hours as opposed to 2 or 3.   Both of my teens had the shot and were fine also.</p>

					<p>I know exactly what you mean! I had my H1N1 shot on November 9th and haven&#8217;t felt normal since. Tingling in arms/hands and feet, pain in hip joints, trouble sleeping and muscle twitching. This is going on 3 months now and I&#8217;m tired of it&#8230;going back to the doctor&#8217;s next week to try and get them to listen that something is not right here.</p>

					<p>I had my h1n1 vax on Nov. 19 2009 along with my husband and four children. I am 39 years old. My life has been permenatly altered since then. Within 12 hours I had tingling in my right foot and leg.  It woke me out of my sleep.  I tried to blow it off as tired muscles.  well, by 2 days after that I was in emergency because I thought for sure I had gullian bare syndrome. The tingling has moved throughout my entire body, I have stiffness in my neck, I feel like there is morris code going off in my  body everywhere, my wrists and ankles hurt, acually my whole body hurts and my head felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat. I  had exteme nausia and some vomiting.My vision has been effected, have been to the optomatrist twice.  No, it gets worse.  To make this story short, I went to 2 different doctors plus a nuerolagist, a rhumatolagist and a naturepathic doctor and this is what they came up with.  I have a posative ana test which suggests a autoimmune  disorder, but the rhumatolagist says there is nothing wrong with me, the nuerolagist did a MRI and I have legions on my brain(I got a copy of this and It suggests that maybe encephalomyelitis )  this can be caused by a vaccine but the neurolagist  says that us unlikely because that usually happens after the MMR vaccine in children(my children will never get another vaccine of any kind so ling as I live) any way  back to the long story short, my sister inlaw just told me that the same thing has happened to a friend of hers( a posative ana test )  I have been seeing a naturepathic doctor who has autoimmune herself and a lot of the crazing body twitching and pains have gone away with the things she has treated me with.  I still have this severe headache and I&#8217;ve decided that I want to be tested for this encephalomyelitis. Enough already, I&#8217;ve suffered enough. I&#8217;d also like to add that when I have mentioned  that I got the h1n1 vaccine to any and all of these doctors, I felt like they where sluffing me off.  Even my own doctor.  Why is it that they don&#8217;t  think that the vaccine  could possibly have bad side effect when I&#8217;m living with them and sitting there in front of them telling them that this is happening to me.  And even having proof with the positive ana test and  the MRI with legions?  I would suggest anyone with the same symptoms as mine , get an ana blood test and an MRI because i never had these before, I know I did&#8217;nt.  I was healthy.</p>

					<p>You almost described me exactly.  I had my vaccine Oct 28, 2009 and am still recovering.  My ANA tested positive and the neurologist I eventually got to see has said there is a temporal association between my symptoms and the vaccine &#8211; after being told for at least two months that it was a coincidence or that I was stressed.  I have had stress in my life, but never anything like this.  Still &#8211; no one will send me for an MRI. </p>
<p>What will this postive ANA and the lesions mean long term?</p>

					<p>My 80 year old father received both the seasonal flu vaccine last month and a few days ago the HINI vaccine. After the first vaccine he experienced flu-like symptoms for a week and was extremely irritable, grouchy, short-tempered. This man is normally in good humor and a quick wit. I had hoped he would think twice before getting another vaccine but he went ahead anyway. He has been experiencing severe cramps and diarrhea since yesterday. My 5 year old niece who received the shot has been complaining about pain in her lower leg and foot. After the shot she said her &#8220;brain hurt&#8221;. Her way of expressing a bad headache. As for her 2 year old sister she has mild rash on her face. She is too young to tell us how she is feeling but I noticed she was screaming and crying a lot and this at her birthday party. As for the rash on the baby&#8217;s face that is still there after two weeks; it was dismissed as &#8220;impossible.&#8221; I&#8217;m worried we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg here and have no idea about long term consequences.<br />
   This is third hand testimony but a friend was called to the hospital because her granddaughter experienced anaphylaxis. She was sent home and was off school for a week. Our town&#8217;s public health officer meanwhile reported to the press there had been no serious adverse reactions.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m a 34 year old female in good health.  I got the H1N1 shot this past monday (Nov 23) and so far my symptoms are:</p>
<p>Sore injection arm, not just the location of the shot. Mild fevers (nothing over 101 F), mild dizzyness, intermittent nausea, intermittent chills and sweating, general weakness and fatigue.  Also some muscle tightness in my left shoulder (shot was given in my left arm).</p>
<p>I find that so far that tylenol takes down the fever when it starts to climb, as well as lessens the arm pain so that it&#8217;s moveable (when the drugs wear off I can&#8217;t lift my arm up very high).</p>

					<p>F, 39, Received th H1N1 vaccination (adjuvanted), Monday Nov 23rd in Vancouver, BC. Side effects for me include, slight fever, fatigue,  aches the first 12 hours. The next day the arm is still warm, red and VERY sore at the injection site, my glands are still swollen and I am also noticing I still have  tightness in the chest that is uncomfortable but managable. All in all this is similar to the experience I have had with other vaccines in that , the  &#8220;Seasonal Flu&#8221;  shot gave me a mild flu for a few days, &#8220;Yellow fever&#8221; vaccine gave me a horrid fever for 24 hours. So this is what I expected for me. I would  say a mild version of what it would be like if I contracted the actual virus which makes me glad I opted for vaccine. I am not prone to chest issues so this tightness indicates to me that I would have chest issues with this virus and while I may have lived through it, I would never forgive myself if a friend or family member with underlying heath conditions died from a bug I passed on to them.</p>

					<p>We would suggest you keep a close eye on your condition in the case of this vaccine.  Side effects are not short-term issues that just &#8220;go away&#8221;, especially with the neural damage that can be caused and surface years later, and the cumulative damage of multiple vaccines.  We wish you well.</p>
<p>But right now, you might want to avoid those people whom you suspect might have underlying health issues, because you&#8217;re now contagious, and will be for some time.  You are correct, you were &#8220;given&#8221; a case of the flu. Check the literature for full information on viral shedding, which fortunately is less pronounced in injectable vaccines as opposed to nasal sprays.</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note: </strong><br />
&#8220;The recall affects <strong>172,000 doses of the Arepanrix vaccine.</strong> &#8230;“We’ve been <strong>asked by the manufacturer GSK</strong> not to use this vaccine at this time pending further investigation,” said Manitoba chief medical officer Joel Kettner. <strong>Thirty-six</strong> Canadians, including one little boy whose face swelled up like a balloon, suffered severe allergic reactions after vaccination. <strong>200 others died</strong>. “It is a serious thing that <strong>has the potential to kill</strong> – but fortunately <strong>seems to be relatively rare,</strong>” said Dr Neil Rau, an infectious disease specialist&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>WE BEG TO DIFFER on &#8220;36 cases&#8221; of adverse reactions, as you can see above. This carnage was from just 172,0000 doses (not a total product recall). We don&#8217;t know how many were administered. It was GSK who recalled it, and not PHAC, who allegedly are there for our &#8220;safety&#8221;.  GSK bears NO liability as the gov&#8217;t absolved them of liability on Sept. 30th, 2009 (CBC &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/09/30/h1n1-vaccine-canada.html" rel="nofollow">Taxpayers on the hook for any H1N1vaccine damages</a>&#8220;). So, can we expect that the gov&#8217;t will tell us all the facts? They put themselves in a position of conflict of interest!<br />

					<p>I got the H1N1 vaccine on Friday, November 6.  My arm was hurting quite a lot within hours of getting the shot.  My arm really hurt the next day and for almost a week after &#8211; hurt enough that it woke me up at night sometimes.  My arm did swell a bit and was warm  and  very, very itchy where they injected me.<br />
The funny thing is this &#8211; and I didn&#8217;t even make the connection until yesterday&#8230;until yesterday I was feeling unusually tired and draggy&#8230;feeling foggy and not with it&#8230;.just wanted to sit on the couch and do nothin &#8211; I woudl have to say that I even felt depressed &#8211; it was really, really weird ( I have nothing to be depressed about &#8211; my life is pretty awesome)&#8230;I wasn&#8217;t sleeping anymore than usual&#8230;just sitting on the couch with absolutely no energy &#8211; this drove me crazy but what bothered me the most was that I was foggy all of the time &#8211; I hated it&#8230;.felt very disconnected from what was going on around me and couldn&#8217;t shake it&#8230;finally, miraculously, yesterday I felt like my old self again and I still feel well again today&#8230;I&#8217;m just afraid whatever I had is going to come back &#8230;.the only thing that makes any sense to me is that I had some kind of reaction from the H1N1 vaccination&#8230;or maybe I&#8217;m just crazy!</p>

					<p>Me and my 3 children got the shot yesterday. Ages 41, 15, 13, 11.<br />
No reactions at all, thought it was a breeze. All we seemed to have is a really sore arm where we were poked.<br />
But&#8230; last night my 13 year old son had such severe stomachache he got me up twice. He never complains like that so I knew he was in pain. When I gave him a Tums it seemed to take away the pain a bit. Needless to say throughout the night he ate about 3 of them. He ended up going to the bathroom twice, first time was normal, second time he had diareha. He is just laying down today and relaxing so I hope that is is for the reactions.</p>
<p>Will write more if anything happens.</p>

					<p>I had the swine flu vaccination Friday, November 20th at a clinic in St.John&#8217;s, Newfoundland. Approximatly 10-30 seconds after the shot, just as soon as I entered the recovery room to wait 15 minutes I had a horrible reaction. It felt like my head started to tingle, then this same tingle went down my arms and my legs, up and down. It was very scary, then I started to wobble like I couldn&#8217;t walk and was feeling over-heated. At the time I felt like I was going to lose consciousness, started feeling emmense anxiety about it all. I never had such a strange feeling in my body before. All that night I felt wiped out, and I&#8217;ve been feeling that way for the past week now (as it&#8217;s been a week since I got the shot). Also I could taste the vaccine in my nose and mouth-if that makes any sense. Sometimes even now still I get this chemical taste, as if it was the vaccine.<br />
I regret getting the shot, I let fear make my decision for me. We really don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s safe at this point. As I said I have been feeling very fatigued since, and I&#8217;m quit concerned about my health. My husband had the shot at the same time, and hasn&#8217;t felt any adverse symptoms. My 6-year old daughter got the shot November 4th, and she&#8217;s been fine as well. So I don&#8217;t know what caused my problems but it&#8217;s been a nightmare.<br />
Also I got a piece of paper (I didn&#8217;t notice at the time) and it said something about the vaccine coming from Australia. Maybe I got that dosage. The nurses there didn&#8217;t even fill out my husband&#8217;s vaccine form, just ticked off second dose on the paper. Geez you think they could do better than that.<br />
Anyways I&#8217;d be interested to hear from others with similiar complaints.<br />
Thanks</p>

					<p>I too could &#8216;taste the vaccine&#8217;. I have minor muscle twitching, and I&#8217;m just keeping an eye on it. My whole family was vaccinated, husband myself and 3 kids. That was 4 weeks ago, and am trying to stay calm so I don&#8217;t cause my mind to freak out. I&#8217;m a healthy 34 yr. old woman who will not be getting this shot next year either! My son should be going back for a second dose, but I am not taking him&#8230;</p>

					<p>I work for health and social services in Montreal so recoeved the regular H1N1 vacine early&#8230;Nov 12th because of the nature of my job.  I had a large hard painful lump on my arm and by Nov 19th my whole arm started to hurt.  It continued to worsen and by the 24th I was in extreme pain, couldn&#8217;t move my arm and my hand was swollen and discoloured.  The nurse at work told me to go to the doctor asap.  They did an ultrasound of my arm and found dead muscle tissue and &#8216;acute&#8217; inflamation at the injection sight.  They did blood tests and it is not infected but they are concerned that it might turn into an abcess.<br />
I have been off work since tuesday Nov 24th.  I spoke to the nurse at work today and she told me that I may not get workmans comp for my time off work (which isn&#8217;t over yet) because it was my choice to get the shot.<br />
We were given a three hour training convincing us why we had to get it and the shot was given at work&#8230;now all of a sudden since I had a reaction, it&#8217;s my fault!!!!<br />
It has been over 2 weeks&#8230;I can barely move my arm and am on pain killers.  Hope it gets better soon.  The hospital said they haven&#8217;t seen this reaction and they don&#8217;t know what will happen.</p>

					<p>I took the h1n1 shot on Nov.24/09.  I had an immediate reaction to it.  I wasn&#8217;t aware or warned that the h1n1 shot was a heavy needle.  I started to get a light fever and head aches.  Around the afternoon, my condition got worse.  I was in-and-out of cold-and-hot chills, vomiting, fits, and passing out.  I had it three times that same night from the shot.  When I passed out my muscles tightened.  I was going in-and-out of chills all night.  I had ended-up in Surrey Memorial Emergency room all night.  I told them that I took the h1n1 shot, but they didn&#8217;t seem to concern about it or the reactions people were getting from it.   At 1 pm they gave me iv.  When I saw the doctor he gave me graval with my iv.  It has helped my stomach.  The following night I had a fever and the next day I had a head-ache.  </p>
<p>The news media is urging people to get the shot, but hasn&#8217;t explained the side effects of the shot very well.  I had no allergic reaction to egg shell.  I thought I was doing the right thing by taken the shot, but now I&#8217;m not too sure now.</p>

					<p>This is antecdotal, but it frustrates me that none of these &#8220;reactions&#8221; will likely be reported.</p>
<p>Close friend &#8211; whole family got H1N1 shot, 3 year old daughter immediately got dizzy, very pale, had to lie down, recovered, they let her leave after about 1/2 hour, developed fever and bad cough within 24 hours, the rest of the family very sore at injection site still (weeks later).</p>
<p>Another very close friend &#8211; whole family got the shot, within a few days of getting the shot, the mom, 2 yo and 4 yo all came down with a very bad chest cold, flu symptoms, very high fevers, chills, shakes, etc.  The mom&#8217;s cough turned to bronchitis, never cleared, 2 weeks later it turned in to bacterial pneumonia, she ended up in hospital for 3 days, tested positive for H1N1 (clearly the shot did not work&#8230;).  Husband had soreness around the injection site and achey and tired for a few days.</p>
<p>Another friend &#8211; whole family got the shot, all of them developed very high fevers, coughs, chills, aches, the mother&#8217;s lasted  over 2 weeks and turned to bronchitis.  She is still recovering and has trouble raising her arm.</p>
<p>My dad &#8211; got the shot, got very sick, bronchial, achey, tired, etc.</p>
<p>The &#8220;flu&#8221;, with all the H1N1 symptoms passed through my work and impacted pretty much every single family, and through my son&#8217;s daycare.  The family&#8217;s who had the shot got SICKER than those of us who did not.  We did not get the shot, but we had the &#8220;flu&#8221; come through our house &#8211; but it was very mild.  I&#8217;m 39 and I had sore throat, fatigue and a &#8220;normal&#8221; cough for about a week, some minor stomach issues for a day.  5 year old had same thing.  2 year old had sore throat, then low fever and vomiting/diarreah, gone within 24 hours, mild fatigue for a few days after.   Husband (who has asthma) had a sore throat and fatigue/cough for a few days.   Same story for my sister and her family who did not get the shot, same for my mom/step dad who are in their 60&#8242;s and did not get the shot.  It seems very consistent in the dozens of families we know and we work with that those who got the shot have been getting WAY sicker than those of us who didn&#8217;t.  Bizarre.</p>

<p>But,  in the article it tells how the gentleman who died was a parapalegic and that he had gotten the flu shot previous to his death. So my thoughts are that if the vaccine is supposed to prevent death from the H1N1 flu then&#8230;&#8230; what good was it for him to have taken the shot?  He died anyways.<br />
So either the flu shot didn&#8217;t work, or he didn&#8217;t really die from H1N1 (maybe he even died from adverse effects of the shot itself?) , or the shot gave him H1N1.</p>
<p>No matter which the case may be&#8230;&#8230; it all points to not taking the shot, in my opinion.</p>

					<p>This response is aimed at both Dana&#8217;s  comment and the one from Burlington Non Vaxer: It is well-known that delivering a virus into one&#8217;s bloodstream via injection (vaccine) is absolutely going to infect you with the virus.  Depending on the state of your immune system, and the strength of the adjuvant (in this case Squalene) this can, and does, cause the very same disease the vaccine is supposed to prevent.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t, anybody, be surprised if you come down with the flu.  </p>
<p>In the case of the paraplegic in Waterloo region, I&#8217;d bet my whole farm the flu shot was instrumental in GIVING him H1N1, and his weakened immune system, further compromised by the squalene (making him allergic to the natural squalene in his brain, muscle tissue and joints) put him down.  Of course the medical community would never admit it, and we&#8217;ll never know the truth&#8230;. but I&#8217;d still bet the farm.</p>

					<p>I got the injection 2 weeks plus..and i can still barely lift my arm.  I am so anti-vaccine, but got talked into getting it, as i was going to Las Vegas, and with all the people there, and possible germs it seemed like the best thing to do.  I regret it making that decision, and wish I could reverse it somehow.  The nurse who injected me told me that the soreness can last for up to 3 weeks.  Well 5 days to go to see if she is right or not.  Go with your gut!  I should have.</p>

					<p>Dear all,</p>
<p> I am supposed to be around 11 week pregnant now. I got my H1N1 vaccine on Nov the 10 th and I started bleeding 2 weeks later. I had ultrasound done which showed that my baby stopped growing at around 8 weeks and this is called missed abortion. I have to go through a medical or surgical approach to remove it.  I am not sure if the vaccine was the cause. I feel so sad.</p>

					<p>I received the normal flu shot on November 22, 2009.  I am from Alberta.  After receiving the vaccine, I was told to wait for the usual 15 minutes.  During that time, I felt the oddest feeling in the back of my neck.  I was sure I was going to faint, and put my head down between my knees. After a bit, I raised up, but I couldn&#8217;t seem to focus my eyes properly, so I thought maybe I should try and get some fresh air.  I stood outside for a bit, and leaned up against the building.  Still had that odd feeling, but I was feeling a little bit better, so went home.<br />
During the rest of the day, I was a little sluggish, and my arm was unbelievably sore, but I thought&#8230;heck, I am going to be fine.  At about 5 am in the morning, I awoke with that odd feeling again.  My eyes felt funny, so I fiddled around, and found the light switch&#8230;Lord, wrong thing to do!&#8230;<br />
I almost screamed with the pain.  I was light sensitive, and upon finally getting my eyes to open, they felt like I had sandpaper in them.  I was wobbly, and my lips felt like rubber, so I went downstairs to the mirror, where I could not believe what was in front of me.<br />
The whites of my eyes were scarlet!  My eyes, face, lips were swollen.  I was not having breathing problems, so I went and sat down.  No way was I going back to sleep!  For the next day, I did not have feeling in my face or lips.  Then slowly it started returning.  I figured I was okay then, except for the arm that at this point I could not move or raise.  &#8220;I was wrong.&#8221;<br />
It started with the headache, then the swollen glands on both sides of my neck, that when I swallowed felt like I had two large marbles in my throat.  To go along with it, each swallow was extremely painful, like I had cut glass in my throat.  (The swollen glands are still occuring and that was over 4 weeks ago).  I had tingling in my feet, legs and hands.  Stomach cramps so bad that I cried.  My left arm felt like it had water running down it.  Since then, I have had severe hand cramps that make my hand swell and unable to use for 2 days at a time.  I get &#8220;pins and needles&#8221; in my fingertips.<br />
Needless to say, I am worried about why I am not getting rid of these symptoms.  The nurse told me that I had had an Adverse Reaction to the vaccine.  In the last week, I have been having &#8220;brain fog&#8221;&#8230;that is the only way I can explain this.  I am not confused, but am doing things that are not normal to my character.  Like going to the Post Office and after getting a parcel ready to be sent, I walk away without paying.  Did it at the grocery store the other day as well&#8230;<br />
I am 57 years of age, a young-at-heart grandmother, art teacher, lift weights and do resistant training&#8230;for starters.  Reading your comments here has helped me realize that I am not the only one reacting to this.<br />
As a note, the nurse that told me that did not make out a report of any kind.  I was just told to be at the clinic in Vermilion, a week later, for my H1N1 shot.  That I likely would be ok.  I did go, because I was told that I fit into the risk category, because I had a bacterial infection attack my lungs 5 years ago.  Had no problems, except for an extremely sore arm, but am quite worried about my strange forgetfulness as of late.</p>

					<p>If I were you, Katrina, I&#8217;d be very concerned.  The duration of your reaction is severe.  I hope that you have chronicled this and reported it to a doctor, because this should have been reported immediately.  The forgetfulness is extremely worrisome, indicative of brain involvement, and while the regular flu shot does not contain squalene, the H1N1 shot does, and you&#8217;ve had it as well.  Injected squalene can cause neuromuscular problems, so please get checked out asap!  I wonder what the timing was on that: did the forgetfulness begin to occur before, or after, the H1N1 shot? </p>
<p>Certainly you had an adverse reaction, and the nurse should have immediately made a report or arranged for it. The severity of the effects warrants it, and unless adequate counts are taken of such results, how can anyone judge the actual safety of the vaccine?</p>
<p>Please do make an appointment immediately to see someone about this, and also do your research (you can start on some of the suggestions on this page) with respect to cleansing your body of the toxicity causing your troubles, so that an informed choice can be made.</p>
<p>WIshing you the best!</p>

					<p>I got the adjuvented shot and was fine for several days after, just a slightly sore arm. Six days later I developed a bad frontal headache, nausea, dizziness, sensitivity to smell. It took a week to get better. Don&#8217;t know what this was, but it was not nice and i am suspicious it may have been a delayed reaction to the vaccination.</p>

					<p>Frankly these reactions scare the hell out of me. I did not get the shot. I have nerve damage from a coughing cold and fever from 15 years ago. When I heard that people were reporting tingles in  their spine and feet and fingertips I KNEW that was a very bad sign.<br />
I was originally told I had a virus in my spine and immediately following being told that, I started stubbing my toes and falling down. I suffered permanent damage and though I know it was not from a shot ( because I didnt have one till well after that) I KNOW that tingles in your spine is a VERY very bad sign. ( it was the number one sign the doctor told me, meant virus  in my spine)<br />
I dont trust these shots at all.</p>

					<p>Wow I am astonished at the amount of people reporting extremely adverse effects from this vaccine&#8230; It is so very obvious that no one in the govt is accurately reporting anything.  &#8230;I wish a speedy recovery for all the people who have received the shot and a hi five for those of us who didn&#8217;t take it.  Take care all</p>
<p>(Editor&#8217;s Note: thanks for your comments and concern Jonny, but again, this page is for reporting adverse side-effects. Had to edit this down substantially, sorry)</p>

					<p>Unfortunately the H1N1 vaccine has some risks and pregnant women are at high risk of miscarrying if they catch H1N1 virus and maybe if they take the vaccine.  The latest reports show 28 US pregnant women have died and there have been miscarriages. I have written an article on how difficult it is to get pregnant after a miscarriage. Please see this site for more information: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/getting-pregnant-after-miscarriage-your-helpful-guide" rel="nofollow">Click Here To Check It Out</a>  The key is to conquer the grief (see how I did it), then check out a natural approach which focuses on building up the condition of your body. From experience I know ovulation is almost unpredictable. Best to you.</p>

					<p>I had both the adjuvanted H1N1 and the seasonal flu on Nov 5th. Since then, I&#8217;ve been weak and have tingling sensations in my hands, feet and along my spine. Also, it felt like bugs were crawling over my right leg at one point.<br />

					<p>On Nov.7/09 my daughter age:13 received the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine in Surrey, BC.<br />
She said she felt warm as we left the office, and turned to look at me, her face was scarlet red, including the whites of her eyes that were tearing up. She grabbed her cheeks and said they were tight. I realized immediately she was reacting and took her back in the Dr. office, The receptionist sat us down in an examination room. My daughter&#8217;s color started to return to normal within minutes. She indicated that her cheeks and under her chin felt tight &#8211; like there was pressure on them. It did not seem to be in her throat or hard to swallow. She continued to feel uneasy.The symptoms seemed to subside and The Dr. and receptionist checked on her for about 1/2 hr. and sent us home, advised us to call 911 if any symptoms returned. No one knows what happened, other than &#8220;she may have reacted to adjuvant&#8221; I had never heard the word before.<br />
The rest of that day and that night &#8211; she had no appetite and  lethargic, I felt it took about 2 weeks for her energy level to come back to complete normal. I could not believe every time I read something else about the vaccince, that I did know before I took my kids for the vaccine. I thought I was doing the right thing. No one in my family will ever get another vaccine.</p>

					<p>December 9th, at noon, both of us received our h1n1 shots.  we both had the first reaction of Dry Mouth and Throat.  Sipping water did not help much and this went away after about an hour.  Within an hour of getting the shot,  I experienced incredible fatigue and slept for about 2 hours.  My husband also experienced fatigue about an hour later than me and slept for a couple of hours too. By dinner time at around 7:30  there was pain and swelling around the injection sight for both of us.  As I write this, we both have headaches as well.  We will see what tomorrow brings.</p>

					<p>Hi, I work in a nursing home and I too gave up on flu shots after 6 yrs ago feeling ill for 2 wks after the shot. From then on lived a heathy life with no sickness or just having a very mild cold since. With the scares of the H1N1 hitting the Hamilton area I decided to take the shot in case. We had to wait 15 minutes after recieving it and I really did not feel immediate effects until 1 hr later. I felt symptoms of light headness, and felt the life sucked out of my body. My arm was sore then became itchy. Later I started to have extreme achy pain on my left knee and grew worse affecting the whole left side with headaches. All through the night I was in pain. The next day went to work still aching and extreme fatique but then I felt nausea. This continued for 2 wks as well accompanying with diarrhea. The headaches and pains went away after 2 wks and the nausea but the fatigue is still there, never left me. I feel like I am in a fog and so tired I have to take a nap after work for 2-3 hours and still feel tired. I am on wk 4 since this shot not able to shake this. I had never felt like this before, never this tired and wondering if anyone has this.</p>

					<p>I live in Nova Scotia, i got my daughter, which is 3 years of age the H1N1 shot a week ago. She woke up with both her eyes swollen and puffed right out. I took her to the doctor and they tell me it probably isnt a reaction from the shot. She has had it for 2 days now, swollen eyes, fever and diarrah. She was perfectly heathly before she had this shot and i know it has to be a side effect from it. Were on day 3 and she is slowly starting to get back to her normal self. I did however talk to the pharma. and i have been giving her Benadryl for allergy&#8230;.and it seems to be working. Thank god she only got half a dose. I am not going back to get her the other half.  I think half dose was good enough. So if anyone experiences swollen eyes try Benadryl. <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  thanks for reading this.</p>

					<p>These are not  firsthand accounts, however I know the individuals who related these episodes to me to be very trustworthy and not inclined to exaggeration.   </p>
<p>The first involved a 12 year old girl who LOST HER SIGHT (not sure if partially or fully) within a half hour of the shot.   Apparently, she is now at a local hospital and the doctors have said that her sight will return in three months.   Only time will tell, but the point is if the vaccine could produce such a violent reaction as blindness, how does this bode for the child&#8217;s future visual health not to mention her broader wellbeing &#8230; Where are the media posters for this suffering child?</p>
<p>I have a contact to works for the local health authority in my city, and she related how there has been quiet discussion amongst some of the staff how women are miscarrying after the H1N1 vaccine but that the &#8220;this is not to be discussed outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>From several others, I&#8217;ve heard of cases of temporary partial facial paralysis; an arm so painful weeks after the fact that the woman must take painkillers; and  of prolonged fevers etc.</p>
<p>If these are accounts simply within my own circle of contacts, I shudder to think how many more there are in the broad population.   Reactions and conditions that are not being addressed by those who pushed this vaccine in officialdom and the media.</p>

<p>Jackhead resident’s death may be H1N1 vaccine related: band councillor<br />
Posted By Heather Robbins<br />
Posted 20 days ago [Nov 21/09?]</p>
<p>A Kinonjeoshtegon (Jackhead) First Nation official says a recently deceased community member may have had H1N1 or had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. </p>
<p>Coun. Rod Traverse of the band says the person was a middle-aged woman with a medical condition. </p>
<p>&#8220;Other than that, she was healthy,&#8221; said Traverse. </p>
<p>Traverse says the woman had been vaccinated for H1N1 the week before. </p>
<p>&#8220;She had a fever and her mother gave her a Tylenol,&#8221; said Traverse. &#8220;She died two hours later.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jackhead&#8217;s public health nurse and the woman&#8217;s family could not be reached for comment. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Manitoba Health and Healthy Living says the province only releases information on lab-confirmed H1N1 cases that result in death. </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of time may pass through the process of investigating and confirming with families as appropriate, but we try to announce confirmed cases as quickly as we can,&#8221; said the spokesperson. &#8220;We announced the first death in the second wave of the virus last Tuesday and we will make further announcements as current as possible.&#8221; </p>
<p>Manitoba Health officials are also investigating two deaths within a week of the persons getting the vaccine, though the province says it wasn&#8217;t likely the cause of these deaths. &#8220;</p>

					<p>I got the h1n1 adjuvanted vaccine Nov 3!  My left arm is still sore at times and I have been having sleeping and eating problems since and muscle twitches but the dr. say its nothing to worry about!<br />
I regret getting this shot!   Since then I&#8217;ve learned the media has hyped the flu 10x worse then it is!  I hoped that this vaccine is safe and all the side effects have been seen since people are claiming this shot to be like the anthrax shot and it took 5-10 years, to come to a realization that there was something going on from the gulf war!</p>

Unfortunately, we are unable to give medical advice. We can only recommend that you see your doctor make sure an adverse reaction report is filed too.  </p>
<p>Also check out some of the previous posts (above) that contained some tips, and check the &#8220;useful links&#8221; section in the margin on the right, as there are a number of doctors there who have spoken out against the vaccinations, and who have written detox protocols.

					<p>I haven&#8217;t had the shot, thankfully. I&#8217;ve heard about some bad reactions though.  My cousin&#8217;s son, who is 10, had it and he felt so sick afterward he had to stay home from school for a couple of days. He had a very sore throat.<br />
I took a taxi on Dec 2nd and the taxi driver told me how sick he had been after his H1N1 vaccine. He said he felt terrible that night. He took Tylenol and the next morning he still felt awful and his gums were bleeding. He phoned his doctor who told him to go to the ER. He went and was given a shot against allergies.</p>

					<p>My 14month old niece Olivia Mannen died 48 hours after receiving the H1N1 vaccination.  The autopsy showed a healthy baby with no pre-existing conditions.  Everyone is heartbroken over this loss.  A friend of ours whose mother is church minister ministered to another family in Sask whose 9 month old died 2 hours after receiving this vaccination.  Why arent these deaths being recorded in the paper.  They are valid statistics that should be recognized.  The coroners have &#8220;noted&#8221; that the babes were vaccinated but cannot state that it was the cause of death.  Report states that cause of death is Asphyxiation.  We would like the whole truth.</p>

					<p>Got the vaccine on December 11th (the one for non-pregnant women).  Initially it was just that my arm was sore, so sore that I couldn&#8217;t lift it at all and needed my GPs help getting my jacket on.  Within a few hours I developed a fever, muscle aches and a neck so stiff I couldn&#8217;t turn my head more than an inch to either side.  I started getting really bad vertigo and wasn&#8217;t able to stand up or even lift my head from the pillow.  My stomach was really queasy and I couldn&#8217;t take any food, or even drink tea.  This has lasted for two days so far, and though I am now less queasy, sore and my fever has gone down, I am still really fatigued and prone to bouts of bad vertigo.  I am a 59 year old woman in Ontario.</p>

					<p>I got the shot on October 28 in Saskatoon at work just before lunch. The shot was the first available, the adjuvant type. I could have got both the regular as well as the h1n1, but decided to get only the h1n1 as I thought it would be too much of an assault on my system.   Within about a half hour, my lips and tongue were tingling and numb.  This went away but by mid afternoon I was unwell with fever aches/pains.  I missed the next 2 days work then I had the weekend to recover.  I had extreme weakness, terrible aches/pains, tinnitus, and felt my eyes were frozen.  It was a struggle to sit up in bed and could hardly get out of the bath.  I seemed to recover from this not completely, and on Nov 13 I started with it all over again.  I missed a week and a half of work.  The pain in my legs was incredible.  And my back.  and hips. I walked the floor for 48 hrs and had hot baths every hour and a half. 1000 mg of painkillers would not touch the pain. Had all the original symptoms again.  I was shuffling when I walked, could barely lift my legs. Feet/lower legs were tingling up to my knees. I should have went to the ER but they were telling people NOT to go the ER&#8230;unless you couldn&#8217;t breathe&#8230;plus I could not manage a 3 hr wait nor did I have cab fare -so neither did I go to a mediclinic until I felt up to driving.  I was very worried about guillanne barre. Still not sure if I could have had it to a certain extent.  I did report this all to the reaction line, who told me that a medical health offer would review it and possibly follow up with me, and they would record it in the database their recommendation as to whether or not I should receive the vaccine again. No one has called me back from public health.  then when I could see my own family physician, I reported this to her.  She told to never get the h1n1 shot again and not to expect a call as she thought they did NOT want to even hear the adverse reactions.  However next year it will be mixed with the regular flu shot.  Not to worry, I will NEVER EVER get either of them again.</p>

					<p>got flu shot last friday. woke up saturday morning dizzy, muscle spasms in my back and neck, dry mouth, and quite weak. dizziness has improved but my head still feels scrambled. finally went to a walk-in clinic and the doc said it sounded like an inner ear problem. really? so, less than 24 hours after receiving this vaccine i experience all these symptoms which sound similar to many here&#8230;haven&#8217;t had an ear inffection in over 30 years (when i was  a kid). it is kind of what i expected from the doc though.</p>

					<p>I received the h1n1 adjuvanated shot in my doctor&#8217;s office (Kitchener, Ontario) in my left arm a few weeks ago and at the time I got it, I was just fine.  It wasn&#8217;t until about 7 hours later that my arm began to hurt!  I could not sleep on that side or use that arm the following day.  Within 3 days the arm pain was pretty much gone, but within that time it was awful!  Within 24 hours of getting it, I also began to get hive looking rash splotches on the left half of my torso and they still are hanging around &#8211; and are a little itchy here and there.  There was nothing else that changed so I am quite sure the shot was the only change to my body/ environment.<br />
I am a 29 year old Caucasian woman who is in generally great health and I have gotten the flu shot every year and never had ANY adverse reactions to them.</p>

					<p>I posted as Maria in mid November. I am now 6 wks post vaccination. My neurologic symptoms are no better (they started 60 hrs post vaccination). Still tingling mostly in feet, but now often feel &#8220;creepy crawlies&#8221; in my legs and arms. I have seen a neurologist who says she &#8220;hasn&#8217;t a clue what&#8217;s going on&#8221; and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t know anything about the vaccine&#8221;. I had to tell her the side effects listed on vaccine&#8217;s website. I have been subjected to nerve conduction studies, autoimmune work up and MRI head &#8211; all normal of course. I have spoken to both a Public Health Doctor as well as GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of the vaccine. They can tell me absolutely nothing as to my prognosis and whether this is permanent. Public Health said they&#8217;d never heard of this reaction. Both told me that there were really no studies as to the side effects of this vaccine. They are &#8220;now&#8221; conducting some clinical trials but because of the &#8220;urgency of the pandemic&#8221; , this vaccine was released without much data.  I find it absolutely disgraceful that Public Health is advertising this vaccine as safe and effective, when almost nothing is known about it. Basically, I have been left to cope with symptoms that maybe permanent. The only reassurance they give me is that I am &#8220;on their database&#8221;. Otherwise I am on my own in dealing with this.   I wonder what legal culpability the governement has if people are permanently damaged by this vaccine. I understand they have given the vaccine manufacturer&#8217;s immunity.</p>

					<p>I am a Massage Therapist in Ontario.<br />
I was at a clients house to treat the mom, dad and 3 kids late October and this is what I was told:</p>
<p>One of their children  had H1N1 a week earlier but was recovering and the family had not contracted the virus luckily-BUT the mom decided that she and the two other kids should get the H1N1 vaccine.<br />
Mom took the kids to a vaccination clinic. They all received their shot for the flu&#8230;whereupon mom asked if it was the H1N1 Vax-it wasn&#8217;t BUT the nurse offered to give them that Vax as well&#8230;so, Mom and the two other kids got the regular flu and the H1N1 Vax that same day.<br />
The dad is against vaccinations so he didn&#8217;t go.<br />
That night when I was there I was shocked to see the mom: she looked like she was nearing death&#8230;white as a ghost, red lips, black circles under her eyes and shaking with chills walking as close to a fetal position as one can get&#8230;I refused to treat her because (my logic was)  if she DID have an adverse reaction the likelihood would be that I would get questioned later&#8230;as the Vaccine is considered &#8216;safe&#8217;.<br />
The kids seemed listless and had slower than normal reaction times in conversation&#8230;pale and looked downright ill.<br />
It was scary.<br />
They all seem to be alright now&#8230;</p>
<p>I had been researching squalene for months prior to this night and was terrified for the family&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>There are implications to the amount of mercury and squalene in the Vaccination for H1N1 that will take some time to surface-years maybe.</p>
<p>I hope the truth is acknowledged sooner rather than later that the Pharmaceutical industry and the Governments of the planned NWO are playing with our lives for their bottom line&#8230;I hope one day this time we are in is seen for what it is and the Medical community involved in &#8216;hushing&#8217; it up is brought to task and stripped of their license to &#8216;practice&#8217;&#8230;after all that is what they are doing, isn&#8217;t it?, practicing&#8230;but for what exactly?</p>

					<p>My 31 year old niece working in nursing homes in Southwestern Ontario felt pressured to take the H1N1 vaccine if she wanted to keep her job. She was hesitant at first but asked a local physician his opinion and sure enough he recommended it. She received it at the beginning of November. Within a few days she experienced a sore throat which has since developed into strep throat. More than six weeks later this young woman has had two courses of antibiotics and is still hoarse. At this point, she is ready to see a throat specialist. She did loose some time off work but for the most part has continued working with the elderly. Whether or not this persistent sore throat is related to the vaccine I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;m not a health professional. Is it a coincidence that she has been struggling with this strep infection since taking the jab? I wonder.<br />
        As a side note, and again I apologize this is second hand and therefore unsubstantiated but a lot of people in Canada lined up for the shot panicked after the death of a thirteen year old boy in Toronto from the swine flu. The media stated he was perfectly healthy but my cousin played hockey with him and claimed the boy was known to have suffered from a heart condition which puts his tragic death into another context.</p>

					<p>I was pressured by my parents and her father and stepmother to get my 12 year old daughter vaccinated. She had the shot on Nov. 19th at school. When she got home, she had bad chest pains. That night she started having a headache, and a couple itchy spots. The next day she had more itchy spots. The morning of the 21st, she was covered in an itchy red rash, fatiqued, and headache.<br />
The 22nd, she was fatiqued and feeling sick,  The 23rd,  the body rash was gone, just lingering red itchy spots here and there. She had headache, fatique, fever, shivering, sweating, and sick to her stomach. On the 24th, the redness, swelling and pain at the injection site was much better, although it was still sore. I contacted the health unit and told them what had happened. I refused all further shots at school. I took her to a pre-existing appointment with an allergy specialist and he will be testing her in the New Year because he needs to wait at least 6 weeks to test.<br />
My other daughter had one because she works with children and it was required. She just had swelling, warmth and redness at the injection shot.<br />
I will not be getting it besides the fact that I have severe neurological problems.</p>

					<p>I had the shot yesterday. I already knew that I was to expect a sore arm (since I&#8217;m accustomed to the flu seasonal flu shot). </p>
<p>Within 8 hours, my shoulder/injection spot was really sore and tender to the touch. By the evening, I couldn&#8217;t sleep on the side of my injection spot. This morning, I have incredible body aches, an odd stabbling pain on the upper right side of my abdomen, and mild headache.</p>
<p>I certainly hope that these symptoms subside soon. If it worsens within the next half day or so, I&#8217;m going to call my health care providers to seek symptom relief.</p>

					<p>My husband and I got both seasonal and H1N1 shots on the same day on Dec. 2nd.  I did not feel well for 2 weeks afterward.  General malaise &#8211; achy, bad headache constantly, chills, nausea, diharrea.  We are off to Mexico in a couple of weeks so thought it best to get shots, but wasn&#8217;t expecting to feel this bad.  I don&#8217;t think getting both at once is a good idea &#8211; it&#8217;s too much for the body &#8211; creating antibodies for two strains.<br />
Finally feeling better now, over two weeks later.</p>

					<p>I had the H1N1 vaccine shot 4 weeks ago and I have broken out into hives absolutely every day now. The hives appear on my neck, arms, legs, and stomach. It varies each day as to where they appear. When the hives appear, it absolutely feels like my skin is crawling. I have gone to my doctor and he does not deny the hives are not due to the vaccine. The only thing that has worked for me is taking Benadryl and this makes me drowsy and puts me to sleep. The last 4 weeks have been an absolute nightmare and I have regretted each day that I had the vaccine. I have never in my life had any reaction to any medicine that has been given to me.</p>

					<p>I am going to see a doctor.  At first I thought it was unrelated.  My other arm aches.  I got the shot in November in my left arm.  My right arm hurt the next day like I had slept on it wrong.  It will seem to get better and then I can&#8217;t sleep again.  I can&#8217;t lift my arm above my head and simple things like washing my hair are challenging.  There is no strength in that arm.  Seems that this is not all that common.  I hope there is something I can do about it.  <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

					<p>I am a 44 year old otherwise healthy female and I got my H1N1 shot on December 17,2009.   I have an egg allergy and had the shot at the doctors office with an antihistamine to coutneract the reaction.  I did not have any swelling at the injection site that I normally get from shots and felt OK for several hours.  I felt my heart racing when I went to bed and managed to fall asleep. Over the course of the next 3 days I experienced heart fluttering, pain in my chest, racing pulse, and light headedness.  When it happens it last for a few minutes, I take a deep breath, sit down and it goes away.  I went to the hospital last night and apparently it is a side effect of the shot.  My ECG was fine but will be put on a heart monitor for 48 hours to try to capture these &#8220;flutters&#8221;.  It is pretty scary as I thought I was having a heart attack.  </p>
<p>I hesitated getting the shot because of my allergy but wanted the kids done so made arrangements with my doctor to get it. Two of my kids had fevers within 4 hours and stayed home from school the next day.  They are still tired and we all have sore arms but it is getting better.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m 22 years old, and received the shot on Wednesday, December 16th, 2009 (exactly a week ago).</p>
<p>The day I received the shot, my arm hurt, but I didn&#8217;t think anything of it.</p>
<p>The next day, I felt fine in the morning, but severely ill in the evening. I was freezing cold (no matter how many blankets I had wrapped around me), running a fever (at the same time as the chills), feeling nauseated (and on the verge of throwing up), really tired, and very disoriented/dizzy. I went to bed early that night.</p>
<p>The next day, I felt fine.</p>
<p>And since then, I&#8217;ve been feeling fine&#8230; except for my arm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week now since the shot, and my arm won&#8217;t stop aching. It&#8217;s swollen, hard, and red around the injection spot, and it&#8217;s painful to lift with that arm. Also, it gets cold easily (like there&#8217;s poor circulation), and it fatigues quickly (even as I type this, it&#8217;s getting tired).</p>
<p>Most sources say that your arm could ache for up to 3 days (72 hours), but my arm has obviously exceeded this time. If it still hurts after Christmas, I&#8217;m going back to my doctor.</p>

					<p>I am from Taber, Alberta and am 58 years old.  I had the regular H1N1 vaccine on Oct. 26th.  It was given in my right arm as I had my seasonal flu vaccine in my left arm the week before in the left arm and the nurse didn&#8217;t want to administer the H1N1 in the same arm a week apart.  </p>
<p>The day after the H1N1, I had neck soreness and then immediately a painful arm.  Tomorrow will be nine weeks and the pain is not getting better.  The pain is 24/7.  If I turn or jar my arm while dressing or other activity, the pain can be excruciating.</p>
<p>I did phone Alberta&#8217;s Health Link after three weeks and the nurse told me their was no connection to the H1N1 vaccine.  I did go to my family doctor, and he as well told me he didn&#8217;t believe it was associated to the vaccine, but thought I had injured my ulnar nerve  I firmly believe it was the H1N1 shot because it was within the next day that I had the arm pain.  I was prescribed an anti-inflammatory  painkiller which would help the pain, but not cure the problem.  I had no accident or any incident that would have caused this other than the vaccine shot. </p>
<p>The first place I found most information about this was a U.S. forum where many people have the same symptoms that I am experiencing.  It really frustrates me because from what I can understand, is that in my case, the injection was done incorrectly.  Best case scenario is 3-5 months recovery and possibly as long as a year.  </p>
<p>I am hurting, debilitated, and somewhat upset.  I don&#8217;t really worry so much about getting the flu, more so about spreading it.  Then this happens.  Then who gets caught picking up the cost of medical expenses &#8211; I don&#8217;t have prescription coverage which is probably the case for many others.  And even non-prescription costs &#8211; I try to avoid taking outside chemicals into my body, but some days the pain is too much and I do take Fast Relief Extra Strength Tylenol.</p>
<p>The future does not hold flu vaccinations for me &#8211; I will take my chances.  But I will not take the chance of this ever happening to me again.  Is this good for the prevention of the spread of the flu?  Probably not.  </p>
<p>I apologize for sounding on the cranky side, that&#8217;s not my normal nature &#8211; I guess constant pain wears you down.</p>
<p>I am an active volunteer in our community and I heard last night that another person in our town has the same symptoms as me from the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

					<p>I am a strong, healthy woman. I received the H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine on November 24 and experienced soreness around the injection site; within hours, it progressed into the muscles of my arm and made joint movement uncomfortable. By two days later, I suffered from a general malaise, and muscle ache throughout my body. I had a day-long bout of extreme diaorrhea, and nasal discharge that I would have normally ascribed to cold symptoms, but the timing was too tight to discount the likelihood of another vaccine symptom. I also developed a pain along the outside of my left leg from hip to knee that made sleeping on my left side too tender to lie on and this has slowly decreased but is still bothersome. I am still fatigued, have mild joint pain, and continue to require extra sleep and naps a month after the vaccine administration, and have had two additional bouts of nasal discharge, each lasting several days. I have never had more than mild tenderness around the injection site of seasonal &#8216;flu&#8217; vaccine. H1N1 vaccine should receive appropriate official medical commentary as it has far more symptoms to be recognised than have seemed to be rather off-handedly disregarded by official government medical sources.</p>

					<p>My family including 9-year old daughter had vaccine on Oct. 31 in Eastern Ontario. All had sore arms for a couple of days. My 9-year old developed mild flu symptoms about 5-days later. This turned into pneumonia which was treated with Anti-biotics. She was off school for the week but did not seem to be getting much better. Muscle pain continued for next four weeks and she was off school entire time. Went back to school for 2 weeks before Christmas with periods each day of feeling good, and periods of being wiped out and in pain. We thought the holidays would put the whole thing behind us but she is as bad now as se was at the beginning &#8211; crying with the pain lying in bed. She has had X-Rays, blood and urine tests and ultrasound with no other indications of anything wrong. Pediatrician is stumped. Doctors say she had H1N1 (caught it during a spike and before the 7-10 days the vaccine requires to work). I am not convinced the vaccine is the cause, but we are beginning to wonder. Whatever we are very frustrated to have no answers for her as she is now at 2 months of living with this. Whether from the actual flu or vaccine this does not seem right, but we do not know where to go from here&#8230;</p>

					<p>Jeff, your doctors are, to put it bluntly, full of it.  There is no such thing as a period of 7-10 days the vaccine requires &#8220;to work&#8221; (very creative, though!).  That information is NOWHERE in the product information, either from Health Canada OR from Glaxo.  What happened was, your daughter has had a severe adverse event and it IS the vaccine.  She caught the FLU from the vaccine (what would one expect, when it&#8217;s INJECTED into you?) but the rest of it is atypical of ANY flu.  It is, however, entirely typical of adverse reactions to SQUALENE. In addition, your entire family became contagious upon receiving the shot (and that IS in the packaging information) and remained so for several weeks.  You daughter could be in severe trouble here. You have no way of knowing what level of allergy may have been caused by the squalene, but what you DO know is you have a very sick child.<br />
Please stay tuned here (as well as reading the info above on how these things might be handled) and ensure you are well informed.  There are ways to deal with your daughter&#8217;s difficulties, but you will not find them within a medical community that refuses to acknowledge the damage this vaccine has done and is doing.<br />
We wish you the very best in getting your daughter well again.</p>

					<p>My 10 year old son got the shot as did all in our family. I got the first because I work in health care. I found it hard to sleep on the very painful arm for about 4 days. But my 10 year old had his shot in November and is still having a reaction to it. He got his shot in the right arm and by the next day, he had a raised rash colorless on his rt chest and rt shoulder blade. We took him to see the Dr. and she confirmed that it was a reaction to the shot. On Dec 29 we took him back to the Dr. because the rash was still there, only worse and in more areas. The rash is not itchy but looks terrible. They prescribed him hydrocortisone cream three times a day. Hope it works.</p>

					<p>I live in Alberta and had to fly to Halifax, N.S., Dec. 23, because my sister was in the hospital, incoherent, eyes closed, couldn&#8217;t move; probably paralysed. Linda had the H1N1 vaccine approx 5 weeks ago, now. My sister has multiple sclerosis and is in a wheelchair and lives in a nursing home. Her brain has always been sharp. When I saw her Dec. 24, she was not the sister I knew.She was almost comatose, a feeding tube in her nose and on intravenous, because she now had pneumonia and a bladder infection, along with no cognitive functions, extreme swelling in her hands and legs. I asked her neurologist if this was a side affect from the H1N1, and of course he said no. Each day when I was there Linda got a little better, however the feeding tube is still in her nose as she cannot swallow. I only hope that the feeling returns so that she can swallow on her own. I feel that this was a side affect of the H1N1 vaccine. Why am I so sure of that?  Well, when I returned to Alberta Dec. 31, my friend Lyndon from Newfoundland introduced me to his sister who was visiting in Alberta. she told me about her brother who had leukemia. He was also given the H1N1 vaccine, and this is definitely an suspicious coincidence. Her brother ended up in the hospital with pneumonia and a bladder infection after being administered the vaccine.</p>

					<p>My 9-year-old son and I had the vaccine mid-November &#8211; I decided to go ahead with it ONLY because my son was considered to be &#8220;high risk&#8221; for complications. For the first 3+ years of his life, he was sick on average 3 of every 4 weeks &#8211; whatever may have been going around, bringing on his asthma, making it that much worse, lasting that much longer, with zone-out type of seizures as well. In recent years, he&#8217;s needed his asthma meds so infrequently that they&#8217;re usually expired by the time they&#8217;re needed and I have to get the prescription renewed.</p>
<p>HOWEVER&#8230;</p>
<p>Three days after getting the H1N1 vaccine in SECHELT, BC he got sick. It came on very quickly, brought on his asthma, lasted for a week. Somewhat better for 2 days, sick another week. Back at school for week 3 post-vaccine, then sick again &#8211; with seizures of a new kind, where his body became distorted and pained (he was cognizant and able to communicate) and of course increased headaches, bizarre joint and body pains.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been getting sick on and off almost instantly, bringing on the asthma. Also has frequent headaches, sudden body and joint pains, and today, for the first time EVER, asthma came on after physical activity &#8211; he went outside to play, came in a half hour later wheezing and had difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>Vaccine was ADJUVANTED.</p>
<p>Also, much of my son&#8217;s body has become covered with bumps &#8211; rash-like, uncoloured, not itchy&#8230; Interestingly, he&#8217;s been experiencing itches where there remains no rash, no bump, no insect bite&#8230; all very odd and completely unusual.</p>
<p>In case it matters &#8211; my son has AUTISM, high functioning.</p>

					<p>Hi Anna, </p>
<p>Your son is getting hives. Those are the colorless bumps all over his body. I have been getting these now for 7 weeks after getting the vaccine. I am so absolutely frustrated, I couldn&#8217;t even tell you. I hope your son gets better soon; I&#8217;m still waiting for the day the rash will disappear. Thanks for your input.</p>

<p>I am in the same boat as you.  It&#8217;s been about seven weeks since I&#8217;ve had the shot, and am still getting hives.  Mine were very severe for about four weeks, and now they are more apart, and not as bad, but still occuring.  It&#8217;s beyond frustrating!!</p>

<p>Have you asked your doctors opinion as to what can be done? The only thing that has helped me in taking Benydrl. I am going to be moving onto my second bottle of 50 in the next couple of days; probably not the best for my body. Nobody has really offered me any real help to a long term cure.</p>

					<p>We DID NOT get the H1N1 vaccine. Thankful now that I read all of this.<br />
We got the seasonal flu vaccine last year (fall 2008). I was 18 weeks pregnant. 6 days later, my water broke. Baby died and I had to deliver. Pathology revealed NOTHING wrong with the baby. They cannot explain it.<br />
Over the past few weeks, it dawned on me that the vaccine may be to blame.</p>

					<p>My mother,who is in Ontario,got the H1N1 shot Nov5 and started feeling sick the next day.The following Monday morning she started speaking gibberish and was belligerent. We phoned 911 and she went to hospital where the mds treated it as a symptom of depression and sent her home. She has social anxiety but has never exhibited signs like this before. Two days later the gibberish talk started again and we gave her orange juice and pedialite because we thought maybe she was dehydrated and she didn&#8217;t want to go the er again. She seemed to come out of it ok,even though she continued to feel week and dizzy.The following day she started having tightness  in her chest and was having uncontrolled movements with her body.We phone 911 again because we were concerned she was having a heart attack.While in hospital she had another bout of gibberish talk and uncontrolled movements.The wonderful caring er doc said she was brought in for chest pains and thats what he was checking and ignored the fact she was having a seizure and wanted her to wait another 6 hrs for blood work and have a stress test. Feeling frustrated they came home again not knowing anything. My sister and I went to see the family md,because my mother couldnt travel due to weakness and dizziness still. The family doc listened to us describe my mothers symptom and concluded she had a type of epilepsy and prescribed anti-seizure meds and booked her in to see a neurologist. All this time she had still been having uncontrolled body twitches.The night before she was to see the neurologist she became extremely dizzy and weak and started vomiting and once again we phoned 911. This time the er doc,a different one this time, admitted her because he had no idea what was wrong. She spent 3 days in hospital were they did blood work and a mri. She was still weak and dizzy so on the last day she refused the anti-seisure meds and the doc released her because there was nothing more she could do. Through this whole episode she had had a cat scan been given blood pressure pills because one doc thought her pressure was a bit high. Along with telling her she had epilepsy,they also told her she had had a series of small strokes and probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to drive. My mother is only in her 60s and has been in fair health her whole life. She finally went to see the neurologist this past week and he told her she did NOT have epilepsy, did Not have a series of small strokes. And that it was probably brought on by depression/anxiety and it was a coincidence that she had the H1N1 shot before all this started. Now I know they call it the PRACTICE of medicine but you would think some one would put two and two together. Thankfully she has had no more bouts of the gibberish talk or involuntary movements and is starting to feel better. It&#8217;s just very disheartening to hear and read all of these stories and know that no one has the cajones to say what it is.</p>

The owners of the website have written at the top of the page: &#8220;If you have experienced any adverse reactions or “side effects” with the vaccine, please share your personal stories with us and other Canadians, If they are “first hand” (personal), or “second hand” (provided that you are close to the person affected, were a witness, and can vouch for the authenticity).&#8221;<br />

					<p>Got my shot on the left arm in Victoria, BC. My whole family had gone together, and my Father had some adverse side effects, and briefly fainted. He eventually started to feel much better, but he still has symptoms of it that have persisted for several weeks now. Myself, I am mostly okay. I had some muscle soreness for the first few days, but now there&#8217;s this strange sensation I can&#8217;t seem to get around. I&#8217;m experiencing bouts of insomnia, and I&#8217;m generally &#8220;out of it&#8221; and feel sort of detached. It&#8217;s not too bad, and it&#8217;s not impeding my daily life too much, but it&#8217;s a strange sensation that I can&#8217;t shake.  It comes and goes in waves, and only started a couple of weeks after the shot. I&#8217;m 20 years old and haven&#8217;t suffered any particularly severe side-effects, but this &#8220;dizzy&#8221; mental state is starting to get a little frustrating. I have no energy.</p>

					<p>Hello, I am a 43 year old healthy women who has had seasonal flu shots with no adverse side effects.  Two days ago, I received both the H1N1 and seasonal flu shot and felt fine that day and the next.  However, I woke up with an itchy facial rash and stomach pain that has lasted all day.  I can&#8217;t seem to function normally and am waiting for the pain to subside this evening.</p>

					<p>I previously posted on December 27th, and am continually researching on this topic through the internet.  I have been in contact with the Health Unit and also the Public Health Agency of Canada, as well I have had another doctor&#8217;s appointment.  I am now at 10 1/2 weeks of arm pain which has now escalated into frozen shoulder as I protected my arm too much.  </p>
<p>My doctor&#8217;s diagnosis has changed from injured nerve to damaged tendon &#8211; I don&#8217;t think he knows.  They say we know our own body and I feel my arm pain is more muscular.  An orthopedic surgeon gave this explanation: that it is muscular inflammation which is a reaction in the deltoid muscle to an ingredient in the vaccine rather than an incorrect placement of the injection.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is being supportive and wants to stay in contact and admits that they don&#8217;t know why some are having the arm pain that I am having.  I don&#8217;t have the same sense of support from the Health Unit and they don&#8217;t seem to want to file an Adverse Effect report while The Canada Agency asked me to have them do it.  </p>
<p>My pain still continues all day.  I have been x-rayed with nothing found.  It was the H1N1 vaccination &#8211; there is no doubt in my mind.  The Health Unit wants to put blinders on &#8211; what they don&#8217;t acknowledge, and what doesn&#8217;t show up on their records, makes everything look great to the public.</p>

					<p>Hello &#8211; had the vacc Dec 11th and have experienced very similar symptoms as most posters here. Have been taken via ambulance to emerg, all tests normal &#8211; doctors willing to listen to my coninced and direct association with the vacc &#8211; this is no coincidence. It has been 1 month and I am still sick with systemic, neuro-type issues, ehaustion, foggy, and numbness of my feet. Have found alot of support on medhelp.org on the immunizations&amp;vaccinations section. We are now on ch. 3  called the Path to Recovery &#8211; check it out.<br />
I have been throught the full spectrum of emotions over this vacc &#8211; dealing with illness/fearful of what is happenig to my body/ongoing worry because the symptoms will not go away/regret/sadness/scared. It&#8217;s horrible. How can so many of us be dealing with this and the is no validation?</p>
<p>My doc said it was an autoimmune like response and the the sensory nerves have been irritated&#8230;will take approx 1more omth to disappear. While extremely looooooonnnnggggg to go through, it does not appear to be GBS or some other horrible disease. Hard to stay positive at times these days after 1 month of this.</p>
<p>Thanks and all the best &#8211; </p>

					<p>Someone on a U.S. forum I&#8217;m on has made a suggestion that we make up and wear t-shirts that say &#8220;I got my flu shot and became one of many who suffered with pain&#8221;.  Another person said the government wouldn&#8217;t allow it.  </p>

					<p>I am so relieved and happy to have found this site.  I am 42, from Calgary Alberta. and received the shot on Wednesday January 13.   I was always reluctant to get the shot as I am the type of person who likes to wait 10 years before trying anything medically new.  Always &#8220;fix it&#8221; problems.  I work in a drugstore, which you handle money, touch people&#8217;s faces (doing make-up) etc.  So that way it&#8217;s a dirty environment.  I have a husband and two children  ages 12 and 15.  My son refuses as well to get the shot, as he dives into research like you wouldn&#8217;t believe.  The pharmacist had the vaccine, and I could get it done without the line ups etc.  So I did it much to my gut feeling I shouldn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>2 hours after, my arm was so sore (normal) big deal, but then I started to feel dizzy and weak.  That night I went home and spent on and off 4 hours in the bathroom with severe diahrrea.  Next day I felt cold, shivery, then sweaty with the odd muscle spasm.  Next day dizziness, weakness, muscular pain and soreness, that it hurt just to move a muscle.  Day after that, much the same way.  Now it&#8217;s day 4&#8230;still feeling weak and soooo tired.  Go to work.  This is today.  2 hours after my shift starts, my neck has bad muscular pain, and weak.  It&#8217;s a challenge to keep my head up.  It moves into my jaw, so much that I have a hard time speaking withoug pain.  Now it feels like I have a 10 pound weight on my glands that&#8217;s pulling them down and it hurts.  I feel like I could pass out at any moment.</p>
<p>I never felt sick before the shot.  It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow on day 5.  As I type this, my ears are bothering me.  Feeling almost like an ear infection.   I hear what the other posters are saying about sensitivity to light.  I am most definitely feeling that as well as sensitivity to sound.  The littlest noise almost sends me over the edge!   </p>
<p>Thank you for starting this website.  I don&#8217;t feel like a freak anymore.  I will continue to post my progress.  Yes, I do regret getting this shot, and I will not force the rest of my family to get it.</p>

					<p>- I received the 50ml AREPANRIX with adjuvant on Monday Nov 30th in Gatineau,QC.<br />
     &#8211; Friday Dec 4th I get a scheduled physical at my GP where I get a booster shot for Tetanus<br />
     &#8211; Around Dec 10th I notice a bald spot in one sideburn<br />
     &#8211; Around Dec 20th it is clear I am losing facial hair<br />
     &#8211; By Christmas I only have a few small patches of facial hair.<br />
     &#8211; Between Christmas and the new year, I suspect I am losing scalp hair.<br />
     &#8211; On Jan 5th I get an appointment with my GP,  a blood sample is taken for thyroid tests<br />
     &#8211; I am still awaiting results of blood tests<br />
     &#8211;  My loss of hair is now visible it may have slowed down but it is possible I go completely bald</p>
<p>      This loss of hair is called alopecia areata, it is an auto-immune condition where your lymphocyte cells attack your hair follicles. My understanding is that the squalene adjuvant is there to suractivate your immune system in order to increase its response to the H1N1 antigens of the vaccine.  Therefore I believe that this sensibilisation of my immune system is responsible of this loss oh hair.</p>

					<p>It is one month since my post and I thought of giving an update. </p>
<p>   The thyroid tests came back negative.  I kept loosing hair to such a  point that I decided to shave my head, it looks less sickly that way.  I also believe that the hairs left are not growing.  I also lost hair on my front torso from the chest down to the pubis.</p>
<p>   I also noticed that the appearance of my fingernails has changed. Starting from the base up to mid-length, some look flaky others look darker than normal  orthers a mix of both conditions. Nails like hairs are made of a protein called keratin.  I also read that squalene the adjuvant used in the AREPANRIX vaccine is a lipid that helps protect hair follicles,  it also plays a role in nails growth.</p>
<p>  On my next visit to the doctor, early March, I will present him a form from the Public Health Agency of Canada to report my immunization side effects.</p>
<p>   I would like to know if other people have experienced the same side effects.</p>

					<p>I had the vacine on December 17th.  It is now over a month later, and my left arm and shoulder are still very sore and stiff.  I&#8217;m 42, and in good shape and very healthy.  I didn&#8217;t feel any other side effects from the injections other than a bit tired the next day.  I expected a few days of stiffness, but this is a bit extreme.  I would rate the pain similar to what you would feel after a vigorous workout after not excercising for a long time.   Thinking of going to the doctor to have it checked out</p>

					<p>We have received a few comments in recent days from outside of Canada. We&#8217;re sorry, and our sympathies are with you, but as stated in the preamble, we are only accepting reports from Canadians who have received the GSK Arepanrix vaccine (which is the only one available in Canada). The USA, UK, Australia and other countries have different manufacturers and the vaccines have different ingredients. It is important to make this distinction and to only report reactions to the Canadian vaccine. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

					<p>Family all received H1N1 shots early November. Husband and youngest (10 yrs) son (who has extreme allergies) both only had sore arm and headache. Oldest (15) son had headache, body ache and extreme malaise. He was so tired didn&#8217;t move from sofa for several days.  The three of them all seem fine now.</p>
<p>However, within 20 minutes of getting the shot myself my nose, part of my face and roof of my mouth went numb and I got a chill from the inside out which started in the middle of my chest. Hard to describe, was kind of like a drop of water and the ripple affect on the water. Very cold. All I could think of was I&#8217;m in the car with my youngest and he has an epi pen and I have another for him at least to buy me 30 minutes for him to call 911 if need be. Was very scarry.  Symptoms lasted about 1/2 hour then subsided.  The next day woke up feeling like I&#8217;d been hit by a truck, very achy very sore.  Noticed roof of mouth numb again but only lasted about 10 minutes.  Had red swollen hot band around my left arm below the injection site for a week after. Felt out of it and had hard time focusing for next several weeks.  </p>
<p>Then fun really started, my right calf muscle &#8220;poped&#8221; walking down stairs first week of December.  Was like something snaped and I couldn&#8217;t walk without sever pain for 2 weeks.  Now I have good days with the muscle and bad days.  Somethimes when I sit for periods of time when I get up again I have trouble stretching it out without alot of pain.  </p>
<p>Have now noticed over the last week (now January 21st) that my right hip and leg to the knee are very sore and achy as well my right hand was swollen this morning when I woke up, couldn&#8217;t close into a fist and my wrist is very painful.  Neck and sholders also are sore and tight.</p>
<p>I have to say that I am 46 and healthy and active before shot.  I had strong reservations to getting this shot but with our youngest with extreme alergies and asthma, we didn&#8217;t want to take the chance of him getting H1N1 and I won&#8217;t give either of my children shots unless I also get them so we all got this one.  Our family will NEVER EVER get another flu vaccine.  Too many things to go wrong and no one taking responsibility for any of them.</p>

					<p>I am a 56 female who works in a physican office and I was STRONGLY urged to get the H1N1.  I didn&#8217;t want to do it but felt pressure to do so.  I never get shots as I just don&#8217;t believe in them and I have always worked in the public without getting sick, just the odd 1 day flu.  Anyway on Nov 4, 2009 I got the H1N1 GSK with little more than a stiff arm for a day or two.  Howcver, I have been experiencing alot of joint stiffness in the past 2-3 months which is new to me.  I was thinking it must be menopause related and it just sucks.  But it just occurred to me that maybe this is a side effect of the H1N1 because I never had this before.  I am finding it hard to do my walking.  My knees are painful, my elbows and shoulders hurt and my ankles feel weak.  I am going to make an appointment with my own Dr. to get some tests done to see if there is a physical reason that shows up or is this a temporary inflammation as a result of the shot?  I certainly hope so because I just don&#8221;t like this new body and if this is the result of menopause and I have lost my flexibility I am most worried about going into my golden years.  I have noticed a significant change in my flexibility and it is affecting my everyday life.</p>

					<p>I got the both flu shots on Nov 3rd. H1N1 on my left and the seasonal on my right. Since then I have had unbelievable pain on my right from the injection site to my shoulder joint. I have gone to the Health Centre 5 times, the last time with the nurse being condesending towards me. She went on to say that I am babying my arm too much and proceeded to show my some stupid excercise I wouldn&#8217;t even try because of my back (broke it in &#8217;97 and have  30% damage). I had to walk out as I just wanted to yell at her.<br />
I have had the pain, fatigue and night sweats since the shots. I have another appointment on Friday and am very nervous about it as it seems pointless but I cannot contiue this way. Sleeping comfortably is a thing of the past it seems, the pain in my joint wakes me up and keeps me up. I live in Nunavut and am unsure where to turn for help.</p>

					<p>Further to my JANUARY 4, 2010 post &#8211; following 2nd week Nov. vaccination in Sechelt, BC</p>
<p>My son&#8217;s cold/flu/asthma symptoms remain relatively at bay (as in he can still go to school most of the time) ONLY as long as he keeps taking his asthma  meds every day &#8211; if he misses a day, he starts getting sick again. Again, this is completely new since the shot.</p>
<p>The body/joint/muscle pains continue, with increased intensity for shorter periods of time. Example, yesterday morning he couldn&#8217;t move without pain throughout most of his body for almost two hours. &#8220;Mama, my bones are broken here and here and here and here and here,&#8221; he kept saying as he pointed to all the places where it hurt. He&#8217;s 9. There were more painful places than that.</p>
<p>He complains of pain in his body on a daily basis &#8211; much in his stomach, too &#8211; usually multiple times a day.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; sleep disturbances are out of control. He no longer sleeps through the night &#8211; average 4-5 nights/week he rouses (not actually awake) with a scream/cry, at least 3 up to 10+ times a night. Complains he can&#8217;t sleep, screams to &#8220;get rid of it!&#8221; and is becoming increasingly physically violent, along with the verbal. Touching him makes it worse. I play along when he allows by getting rid of whatever, but this is completely out of the norm/expected/ordinary for any kind of night terror frequency I&#8217;ve researched. He never has any recollection of any of it. Not only am I deprived of sleep, so is he &#8211; pale with circles under his eyes. </p>
<p>Scheduled to see neurologist March 18 &#8211; EEG, then doc.</p>
<p>Will update.</p>
<p>As this continues, I grow increasingly concerned for the long-term&#8230;</p>

					<p>On December 23rd, my wife and I received both the H1N1 &amp; seasonal flu shots at the same time. As expected, there was swelling and significant discomfort in the arm where the H1N1 shot was injected; while my arm recovered fairly soon, it took at least a week before the swelling went down in my wife&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>On January 3rd, she developed an intense migraine that also made her eyes extremely bloodshot. This migraine lasted almost the entire week that followed, complimented by minor flu-like symptoms (runniness, congestion), upper &amp; lower back pain and a &#8220;pins &amp; needles&#8221; sensation in the bottom of her toes on both feet. This numbness persisted and, after a couple days, we visited our physician who suspected that she may have caught the flu after all but was open to explore the numbness further after the flu-like symptoms had run their course.</p>
<p>By January 7th, the &#8220;pins &amp; needles&#8221; (numbness) sensation had spread to the 4th (ring) and 5th (baby) fingers on both hands. The back pain had also intensified, making it difficult to sit upright or stand for extended periods of time. We opted to visit the ER at NYGH where it was determined that my wife&#8217;s heart rate and glucose levels were high. She responded well to reflex, strength and motor tests. After more than 6 hours, we were discharged with the recommendation of taking 600mg doses of ibuprofen for the pain and working on reducing the blood sugar.</p>
<p>Not only was there no improvement but, by 5:00a on January 9th, my wife developed partial paralysis in the left side of her face. Her left eyelids were not able to close completely and half of her mouth wouldn&#8217;t move, slightly impairing her speech and ability to drink properly. She also felt that the &#8220;pins &amp; needles&#8221; sensation had spread throughout her fingers as well as the bottom of her feet. We returned to the ER at NYGH where we bypassed triage. In acute care, my wife had a new blood panel, ECG and CT scan of her head. Again, blood sugar high. Heart rate high. No other apparent issues in ECG and CT scan revealed nothing. ER doctor recommended referral back to family physician to discuss possible diagnosis of diabetes as well as referral to neurologist to address &#8220;pins &amp; needles&#8221;.</p>
<p>As far as the back pain, my in-laws questioned the possibility that there was an issue of a chiropractic nature. The chiropractor did identify some &#8216;structural&#8217; concerns which were likely attributable to the extensive bedrest and performed some gentle adjustments. My wife was also tended to by the RMT who recognized concentrated areas of pain in her upper neck as well as her SI joints at the lower end of her spine. The massage did provide some relief but, upon our return home, my wife&#8217;s legs failed beyond the first two steps in our flight of stairs. </p>
<p>On January 13th, we followed up with our family physician who expedited a referral to another neurologist as the hospital&#8217;s referral would not see my wife until March. While prepared to diagnose type 2 diabetes on account of the glucose level, the physician prescribed Metformin (500mg, 2x daily = 1000mg) to address the glucose and Baclofen for the back pain. With the Metformin, the physician expected a reduction of symptoms before we would see the neurologist on January 19th.</p>
<p>By the morning of January 19th, the pain was excruciating, making it difficult to stand or sit. Further, the &#8220;pins &amp; needles&#8221; was debilitating in that my wife had no balance and could not walk without my help, albeit very slowly and not for long strides. However, the neurologist&#8217;s assessment ruled out neurological disorders, without the aid of diagnostic imaging (CT, MRI), and he strongly felt that the symptoms were primarily attributable to diabetes. He prescribed Desipramine and Tramacet for the pain and referred us back to our physician to arrange referral to an endocrinologist and diabetes clinic. Blood sugar remained high over the course of the week. Nausea and hot flushes added to the list of symptoms, leaving Tramacet suspect. Our physician agreed to increase the Metformin dosage to 2000mg @ 1000mg 2x daily and ceased Tramacet to eliminate the hot flushes and nausea.</p>
<p>On January 25th, we were to see the physician for the follow-up but my wife could barely make it down the stairs, given the debilitating numbness and excruciating pain. Instead of going to the doctor, we returned once again to NYGH. Interestingly, on this visit, they took notice of the high heart rate, high glucose and numbness and pain symptoms. Because she was barely able to walk, they admitted her.</p>
<p>Since January 25th, spinal X-ray revealed no &#8216;mechanical&#8217; issues. The attending physician drew concern to the heart rate and inability to walk but did not feel confident that her symptoms were attributable to diabetes, given their course of progression, potentially ruling out diabetic neuropathy as the cause for the numbness. The neurologist ordered an MRI of my wife&#8217;s neck area and did not find any signs of inflammation, once again ruling out neurological disorders. He too dismissed the likelihood of diabetic neuropathy. At this point, there has been consideration of the possibility that, while the high glucose level supports the diagnosis of diabetes, the other symptoms are attributable to complications of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>My wife&#8217;s leg muscles have deconditioned due to the extensive bedrest, thus requiring physiotherapy. The attending physician is still working to address concerns regarding the high heart rate as well as a bladder infection. We have yet to receive results from the echocardiogram but, otherwise, no answers have been found for the numbness in her hands and feet or the pain in the two areas of her back.</p>
<p>I am hoping that this detailed chronology might help draw some connections with others who have experienced significant symptoms within two weeks of receiving their H1N1 shot. We could use some answers from those who might be able to relate to the above details.</p>

					<p>My husband had the H1N1 shot in December. His arm and hand have swelled and his left chest also has swelled for two months now.  The doctor thinks he may have lymphoma but he has had a CT scan, an x-ray and an ultrasound and nothing has shown up. He has taken three rounds of three different antibiotics but nothing has affected it. It is still swollen and this is February.</p>

					<p>Received H1N1 vaccine (adjuvanted) nine days ago. Experienced fatigue, body aches, and abdominal pain afterward. That evening, I also got a productive cough and would go into coughing fits to the point I could barely breathe. Fatigue has been extreme. Have barely been able to get out of bed all week, and can barely stand long enough to shower. Two days ago I began experiencing chills (but no fever), body aches, leg pain, loss of appetite, migraines, nausea, and really bad back pain. Very concerned especially about the fatigue. I&#8217;ve been very shaky and experiencing all-over weakness. Greatly regret receiving this injection. Was &#8220;scared&#8221; into it, because they said I was high-risk (young woman (25), and have the autoimmune disease Hashimoto&#8217;s (hypothyroidism).</p>

					<p>Toronto Sun reporting again today: &#8220;Andrew Morrison, spokeman for the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, said the cases include four vaccine recipients who came down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) — a rare neurological condition characterized by sudden weakness or parlysis. Another 13 people came down with anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction which can include symptoms of anaphylactic shock, rapid heartbeat, itchiness in the skin and difficulty breathing.&#8221;</p>

					<p>I work in a Chronic care hospital where they were strongly urged to get the H1N1, and have heard many patients complaining about the side effects they had from it including flu symptoms, extreme tenderness on the arm of injection, a lot of swelling and pain, brusing (not just on the arm but over the whole body). One woman said within a couple days after she nearly died as she started to bleed internally&#8230;something that had never happened to her before.  A lot of patients said their arthritis had worsened and many felt very sick for days aftewards. I&#8217;ve noticed that patients are having more lab testing done than ever because they feel so unwell.  Many patients have told me that they will never again have any flu shots.</p>

					<p>The following reactions were reported to me:<br />
-A man I met while flyering in Montreal said his sister-in-law came down with GBS after the shot.<br />
- A woman I met while flyering said her toddler son became ill with fever and aches after the vaccine.<br />
-A woman contacted me on the Internet and said her mother came down with GBS within the week of receiving her shot. Her doctor insisted her condition must have been caused by some virus she had contracted, not the shot. She had had no pre-existing health condition.<br />
-The daycare provider of a friend died within a few days of receiving the shot. He was middle-aged and had no pre-existing conditions. This occurred in Quebec and was not reported in the news.<br />
Another friend of this same friend was 5 months pregnant when she received her H1N1 vaccine. She lost her baby 3 or 4 days later. No cause was determined for her loss. This is strange as second trimester pregnancy loss is fairly unusual and is most commonly caused by an incompetent cervix.<br />
- Two other women I met on the Internet told me they miscarried within 3 days of receiving their shots. They were both late in the 1st trimester and miscarriage rate is usually about 3% after 9 weeks.<br />
-My friend&#8217;s 9-year-old niece received the shot and came down with a severe respiratory infection almost immediately ad was put on antibiotics. She had been perfectly healthy when she took her vaccine. She had also received Gardasil on the same day.<br />
-Another friend&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s arm swelled up after she was given the H1N1 vaccine.<br />
-Today one woman who works at my son&#8217;s daycare told me that her arm swelled after the shot and she has had a strange rash on the arm ever since. She showed me the rash. It looked like  peach-colored raised patches. Ironically, she said she makes a point of eating only organic food. She also said she felt like she had been suckered into taking the shot.</p>

					<p>Im a 24 year old and on Nov 5th I got the h1n1 shot with my 4 year old little boy and about 5 days later I got a red burning rash on my hands,it was only there for about 3 days,not a big deal.On Nov 15 I started getting what felt like muscle flutters in my left calf so I started reading up on GBS on the internet and got all freaked out,but friends and family got me calmed down and convinced me it was stress.Well with in days the flutters started all over my body,worse in the legs.So i went into a doctor who told me it could be h1n1,or a reaction to the shot or MS but there was nothing she was gonna do for me,she said to go see my family doctor.Went and seen family doctor,she noticed I had a rapid heart rate but she wasnt concerned about the fluttering and she didnt think the shot caused it.So I went on for about a month with just flutters.By mid Dec my left calf had stiffened up and stayed that way for a week.I went and seen another doctor and he said he would take tests to see if I had some kind of deficiency.All blood work was fine except slightly elevated calcium.Through all of this I still had a rapid heart rate so I was put on a beta blocker.The Doctor took other blood tests but everything came back fine.Since then I have started getting really bad chest pain,a neck that tenses on and off like 20 times a day,a terrible sore throat and muscle aches every where.Ive been to 6 different doctors and everyone of them says Im fine.They pretty much say Im to0 young to have any real issues.Im very frustrated,because Im in pain and Im uncomfortable and nobody is listening to me,and Im scared by the time a doctor takes me seriously It will be to late. Oh ya and along with my muscle problems,I have had the tingling and numbing all over my body. I will NEVER take a vaccine again.</p>

					<p>I too will never take this vaccine again.  I got the shot in Nov. and was fine for about a week.  Then I started experiencing side effects, such as headaches, a very sore stomach that caused me to pass out.  Then about two weeks later I started having terrible neck pain and feeling unsteady and having many  dizzy spells.   One morning I could not walk steady on my own, so my husband took me to the hospital.  He had to wheel me in on a wheel chair, as all I wanted to do was fall over.  They told me that I had Vertigo (an inner ear problem) and sent me home with pills.  Since then I  can not believe the number of people who have Vertigo and just in the past few months.  I am willing to bet that everyone of those people have had the H1N1.   Since being told that I have Vertigo, I continue to experience, dizzy spells, have a sore neck. rapid heart beat and an elevated blood pressure.  I also have bouts of a choking feeling and not being able to breath and my sense of smell has intensified.  I am tired all the time and haven&#8217;t felt well since November.  I am 61 yrs. old and have not been on any medication all my life till now.  I was in excellent health and exercised lots and now I can hardly go for a walk.  Hopefully this will go away as I really do not want this inner ear problem and tiredness for the rest of my life.</p>

					<p>Toronto Sun AGAIN with more stories of GBS, two more horrific stories  here:<br />
<a href="http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/michele_mandel/2010/02/06/12774076.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/michele_mandel/2010/02/06/12774076.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;According to the ministry of health, they are investigating just four reported cases of GBS in Ontario following the province’s mass inoculation of five million people.</p>
<p>But we’ve already told the harrowing stories of two patients who blame their debilitating onset of GBS on the swine flu shot — which they received within days of each other at the same Markham doctors’ clinic.</p>
<p>Since then, four more GBS victims have come forward to the Sunday Sun. With the addition of a Hamilton case reported last November, that’s seven Ontario cases by our count alone.</p>
<p>So exactly how many have really been devastated by this highly touted vaccine?&#8221;</p>

					<p>i had my HINI flue injection on Nov.17,2009. Since that time my left arm has been very painful to the point that I can barely lift it without  feeling severe pain. I find it difficult to even put my shirt on to put my left arm into the left sleeve of my shirt. I have gone back to my Doctor to complain about this pain and told me that probably he was able to put the needle of the syringe in a nerve and this is why I have the pain. He prescribed me an ointment to put on my affected arm, but I had to stop this since I was getting a rash in my left arm. My Doctor told me that probably I would have to have Ultra Sound treatments. I have not had this Ultra Sound treatments yet.</p>

					<p>my son and I both had h1n1 shots, then got the flu itself, and i have NEVER BEEN SO SICK IN MY LIFE, I TRULY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE,  EVERY SYMPTOM,, THAT THE VACCINATIONS WERE GIVING I HAD, BUT THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE, I WAS SICK WITH THE INITIAL FLU FOR TWO WEEKS, AND WAS COMPLETELY BEDRIDDEN,NOT EVEN COHERANT, AFTERWARDS ONLY TO BE FOLLOWED BY PNEUMONIA, WHICH TOOK ALMOST ALL THE LIFE OUT OF ME,i call it the heabie jeabies, and i felt like i was crawling our of my skin for an entire month, muscle spasms, and i couldn;t breath at all, completely lethargic, couldn;t move, it was everything to keep enough fluid in me i was sweating so badly, soaking wet, and i couldn;t drink enough fluid, and the fever was so bad my healthy 14 year old son was sick for almost as long as me, and almost as sick as i was, \my fever was so high, ihad a rash all over my face, chest, stomach, and back, at one point my fever was 104, and i was delusional in the tub, i was scrawny to begin with, but near the end of my illness, which it had been a month, i weighed 89 pounds, i am 5&#8217;5, it took until the end of January, I had the flu in the middle of October,, it took until the end of January for me to not feel so tired that i seriously thought i would never ever feel better, my husband and i decided, that our other son, wouldnt get the vaccination, nor would my husband, even though they seen how sick we were, they wouldn;t take the shot.</p>
<p>i feel alot of people are actually getting the h1n1 from the vaccine. alot of the reactions to the vaccine really ressemble the flu itself, I have had the flu itself, and alot of these reactions are exactly how i felt when i was in full blown sickness with the flu, but with a million times worse symptoms, i feel better, but not completely, and i am so tired all the time,. i can never seem to feel like i felt before i had this most horrible horrible disease, but i am an advocate to NOT GET THE VACCINE, AS I NOTICED IT WAS RAMPANT, AFTER THEY VACCINATED, ONLY AFTER THEY VACCINATED, DID THE FLU GO CRAZY IN MY TOWN</p>

					<p>I have commented on your site previously and continue with my arm pain since Oct. 26th.  If symptoms continue beyond four weeks I strongly urge you to report them to the following agency:  Public Health Agency of Canada 613-957-0247.  They can&#8217;t record it, if you don&#8217;t report it.</p>
<p>I am stuck waiting for an appointment with a nerve specialist and an MRI and my symptoms are getting worse, not better.  In the meantime &#8211; nothing but pain killers.</p>
<p>I believe there was something in the vaccine that did harm to some of us and it needs to be made public &#8211; people need to be informed that there are side affects that are long lasting and we are not getting the medical attention we need.</p>

					<p>I have been having similar right shoulder and arm and hand pain since my injection on Oct 26/09.  Frozen shoulder was diagnosed due to protection of my arm.  My ROM has gotten better but the pain is still there&#8230;.Pain killers etc&#8230;..tingling, numbness in my whole arm to my fingertips.</p>
<p>Last month I started having a bit of twitching in my right arm.  This has now gotten worse, my whole body twitches waking even my boyfriend up!! I have been off work since Nov 26th. No sleep, pain and twitching.  </p>
<p>I was given a cortisone shot from my family Dr.  No improvement.<br />
I was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon for some insite.  I was then given a second cortisone shot.  Crossing my fingers that this would work.  With no success!! In the meantime the orthopedic surgeon, questioned the infectious control Dr in the Hospital about my condition.  He said that &#8220;this is the first time he has seen a case like this&#8221;&#8230;hmmmmmm  I knew I was&#8217;nt  the only one.</p>
<p> Now still on pain killers anti-inflammatory&#8217;s and other medication for secondary reaction to the injection.</p>
<p>Still off work! and more Dr appointments but no answers!! Very frustrating! I am starting to wonder if this will be permenant.</p>

					<p>There are a great many people on this page who are suffering long-term damage from the H1N1 vaccine, and have found little recourse.  However, you all need to know that the waivers you signed are legally useless: They protect no-one, because INFORMED CONSENT was not given, and the waiver must include fully-informed consent in order to be valid.  </p>
<p>The Canadian government was much less than forthcoming on the explanation of risk factors, lack of testing, and most particularly did not tell people that they might miscarry, or even die, or in what sort of numbers.  Yet they DID admit that they expect some will be harmed.  They KNEW, but they failed to inform properly, and in fact it was IMPOSSIBLE to properly inform anyone, since each person&#8217;s body is different, and will react differently, as well as being more or less subject to risk factors being realized on a unique basis.  This was not communicated to people, nor was there any way for people to know in advance.</p>
<p>This information was based on what I learned in a law class with Professor Robert Solomon of the University of Western Ontario Law School, who said, &#8220;Waivers aren&#8217;t worth the paper they shouldn&#8217;t be written on&#8221;, because they do NOT guarantee informed consent, and therefore cannot form part of a lawful contract.  &#8220;Informed consent &#8221; is entrenched in ALL LAW, and is a part of every bit of health legislation in the country, if not the world.  If it is not present, there is no contract&#8230;. and no indemnification!</p>
<p>For those of you who have been grievously harmed, my deepest sympathies; but do not for a hot second believe you are powerless.  Speak to a lawyer, and find out what your real rights are!<br />
(Please do not construe this as legal advice: I am not a lawyer.  But DO follow up with a legal practitioner to confirm.  And do NOT assume that because you signed a waiver, you are stuck!)</p>

					<p>I am 61 years old, work in the health care system.  Regretfully had the H1N1 shot at the Public Health Unit in Windsor, Ontario Oct. 27, 2009.   Person giving the shot stated I had a very tense muscle, she gave the injection very high near the bone.  She pushed the needle into the area.  I was in extreme pain after this.   Muscle aching persisted in the left arm for weeks and then months, across the back of my shoulders and into the right arm.  Muscle aching down the right arm into the fingertips, thigh areas, hip joints.  i have been working and complaining about this since the shot.  I stated three days after getting the shot I don&#8217;t know why I ever did it.  Now it three months past, muscle aching is worsening in both arms with weakness, vision loss,  temporal lobe veins occasionally protruding, extreme tiredness particulary if I am not as active at work during the day.  Activity on my feet makes it lessen for some reason.   Severe tiredness after a day&#8217;s work requiring sleep right away.   I am an extremely active person with four teenagers and five grandchildren.   My energy has depleted immensely.  I don&#8217;t usually go to doctors only once a year or two to maintain one.    So this week I am going to complain about these severe symptoms since they are not lessening but worsening.  Muscle will almost lock up in my right arm between the elbow and hand on driivng.  Cold bothers it.  Hot baths with epsom salts helps.   Naprosyn products does not touch the achiness.   I am going to have lab work this week to see what my counts are.  I do blame this on the vaccination fully.  My friends and colleagues at work can verify this.</p>

					<p>I am a 48 year old male from Maple Ridge B.C.  After getting my H1N1 shot In January I have a number of things that bother me. I have a sharp pain in my sholder like a pinched nerve. I am getting pain in my fingers and numbing in my face. I feel like a have a rash that burns  but can&#8217;t see any rash. Can the shot cause nerve damage in my face. I got my shot through my work. I felt I had to get the shot  as I am a truck driver and work with the public. Thank you</p>

					<p>My cousin received the H1N1 shot back in November 2009.  He experienced pain in his arm where the shot was given and could not lift his hand up to get a kleenex out of the box.  It is only recently that the pain is now almost all gone and that his hand is almost back to normal.  However, he is still experiencing numbness and tingling in his hand.  He also developed some sort of flu for a month after receiving the shot.</p>
<p>When he went to a clinic after experiencing these symptoms, a nurse there told him to never get the H1N1 shot again.</p>
<p>Luckily, he is getting better but it has taken 3 months for a noticeable improvement.</p>

					<p>I am a healthy 53 yr old woman with no health issues other than sciatic pain in the left leg which I have had for years.  In the middle of November I was given the H1N1 shot together with the seasonal flu shot on each arm.  Two weeks later, I started experiencing severe joint and muscle pain in my left wrist and thumb.  I thought it would go away.  When it did not, went to the doctor who told me that I had tendonitis and to keep taking 1200 mg of tylenol a day.  I did this, but the pain did not go away, and the rest of my body esp the joints in my hands, arms, back and feet started hurting uncontrollably.  This pain and throbbing is now constant.  I have checked everything, my diet has not changed, nothing!  This has started since I had the h1n1 shot.  I have taken the seasonal flu shot for the past 15 yrs and never had a problem.  My sister had the H1n1 same time as I did in Edmonton and she is having the same pain.  The doctors are unwilling to believe this!  I am at a loss, don&#8217;t know what to do.  My naturopath says it is caused by H1N1 but I don&#8217;t want to take any cortisone shots etc.  Will this ever go away?  Has anyone else experienced this? Any solutions? PLEASE HELP!<br />
Thanks a million.</p>

					<p>Am 53 years old from Penticton, B.C. and had flu shot and h1n1 shot taken at the same time as I was told that it was ok by the people administering it. Took the shots first week of December, 2009 and had no immediate reactons. Third week, Boxing Day, started breaking out in hives in my scalph and forehead. Till today am still breaking out in hives all over my body, swollen lips which alternates up and lower lips, alternating swollen eyelids, chest, legs, arms etc&#8230; Been taking pictures everyday. Doctor put me on starting dose of prednisone at 50 mgs, tapering to 5 mg in two months plus 10 mgs of antihistamine in the morning and 10mg at night. I have no energy whatsoever as i feel like a zombie all day from these drugs. It is a trial and error medicationj in my belief and it seem not to be helping at all. The specialist told me that it is most likely from the vaccines but she cannot prove it yet. I have started to feel pain in my left arm and feel that my heart area is throbbing. I feel piercing pain once in awhile in my kidney area after taking medication feeling like my organ cannot process all these drugs. I have now gained 12 pounds in three weeks. I have had no problems before i took these vaccines and was fit and active. Now i feel like a vegetable, no energy and can sleep all day. Thanks for having this website as it makes me feel better just to tell other people. The government should at least get some remedies on the table as it is a serious matter for all people affected.</p>

					<p>mal randhawa,</p>
<p>I have had chronic hives now for four months and after at least 6 blood tests, visits to the dermatologist, immunologist, allergist, naturuopath, everything is &#8220;perfect&#8221; in the tests but I am still dealing with it and nobody can explain why.  Its just an autoimmune reaction (presumed) that will hopefully go away soon they say.  The natruropathic Dr. suggested the possibility that the adjuvant in the h1N1 vaccine may have stimulated my immune system to overreact and hence the 4 months of hives.  However, since I didn&#8217;t have any reaction for about a month after getting the shot, the &#8220;real&#8221; Doctors deny this.  I had the same symptoms as you&#8230; Xmas eve (about 4 wks after getting the shot) I awoke at 4 am with swelling eyes lips etc., hives everywhere, you name it.  The immunologist has gotten me off the prednisone (hopefully you have by now as well), and onto Alprazolam (primarily for anxiety but also has antihistamine properties) and this is working soooooo much better than anything without the negative side effects of prenisone (although it make me drowsy).  I also take aerius and about 60-80 mgs of Reactine daily and have minimal symptoms now.</p>

					<p>Just came across this site and thought I&#8217;d also share&#8230;my mom has been sick ever since she got both seasonal and h1n1 shots in the fall &#8211; it&#8217;s now February and she now has pneumonia after struggling all winter with back pain, anemia, stomach infection, mouth infection (so let&#8217;s give her more and more antibiotics) but no flu symptoms.  Could be all coincidental&#8230;could be a direct result?  She has a number of chronic conditions (she&#8217;s almost 77) but none of these ailments can be directly linked to her heart or diabetes.  I think there are many more people who have been affected by this vaccine but as someone posted, no one is really taking count.  Thanks to this blog to allow some venting of frustration and perhaps a better view into what&#8217;s really going on out there.  My only wish is for people to take care of themselves as best they can without relying on the government (for anything!) for health advice.  Even the WHO is dealing with pharmaceutical companies that don&#8217;t have the best reputations or clean track records&#8230;but somehow, that doesn&#8217;t make the front page.</p>

					<p>My son and I received the H1N1 (adjuvanted) on Feb 24th, 2009 in the morning. I did not want to get the shot due to the controversy over the testing,  but my Doctor suggested it since we are taking an extended vacation in the southern hemisphere and they are predicting an outbreak there in the near future (not sure how they can predict that?)   Within 20 minutes of getting the shot  i felt a tightness in my chest and was a bit shakey and sweating.  I stayed home from work, but my son went off to school for the rest of the day and when he came home was complaining of a headache.  I felt better in the afternoon, but by around 9:00, I had trouble chewing and swallowing noticed my tongue felt swollen.  My son was not himself the entire evening, quite tired and lethargic.  I woke up 3 times in the night sweating.  My son woke up in the morning with a headache and his right eye slightly pinkish in colour. I put some drops in his eye and gave him some advil and  sent him off to school. Today my hands and arms were itchy on and off during the day. My son called my at noon to pick him up as he was not feeling well.  He had dark circles under his eyes and a headache.  We both came home and rested. We had a late afternoon nap and when we woke up, he felt better, but I had a nose bleed when I got up.  We are both fairly heathly, with no allergies or previous history of major illness.  We have both received the seasonal flu shot in the past with no issues.  I am not one to run out and get these shots just because of the media hype and had no intention of getting this vaccine originally.  I will not get it again and will not recommend it.  I&#8217;m hoping in the next day or 2 these reactions subside, but i&#8217;m a little disturbed reading the other entries from people who have had long term effects.  Not to mention, the only thing I read online about this shot from the government or medical profession s there are minimal adverse reactions, yet there are thousands of posts out there saying otherwise.</p>

					<p>Another poor souls life blighted by this toxic vaccine;<br />
H1N1 shot blamed for Calgary woman&#8217;s rare disorder<br />
23 Feb 2010<br />
A Calgary woman regrets getting the H1N1 shot after her doctor told her it likely caused a rare and painful disorder.</p>
<p>Norma Goldring said she felt compelled to get an H1N1 vaccine because she is diabetic and has had a heart attack, two factors that Alberta Health noted as putting people at higher risk for serious complications from swine flu.</p>
<p>But soon after getting the shot last winter, Goldring felt ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;My body was aching and I was throwing up. Then I developed a spot on my leg,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The rash spread quickly and Goldring ended up in hospital on Christmas Day. &#8220;By the time I got to emergency, it spread pretty bad and turned to blisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her kidneys were shutting down. Doctors eventually diagnosed it as vasculitis, an inflammation that destroys blood vessels.</p>
<p>Her doctor, who asked not to be named, concluded it was probably connected to the H1N1 shot.<br />
 Desmond Fordyce, her partner, said he is worried the vaccine wasn&#8217;t tested properly before widespread public vaccinations began.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re killing you more than giving you something for making you better,&#8221; he said.<br />

					<p>I had the h1n1 vaccine as soon as it was available.  after about 1 hour i was sitting down eating lunch, when all of a sudden my whole head went dizzy very badly like never befor, I almost fell out of my chair.  I phoned the hospital, they said its a normal reaction.  Well i still get dizzy spells all the time now, feels like i am in a mild earthquake alot.  Also my BP was always 114 over 76 give or take a few numbers, now i am 114 over 48,,, nothing else has changed in my life to do that, again the drs say its a great number and i am just so healthy&#8230;  I find it strange that i have a new blood pressure and I am dizzy almost every day.  If i had to do it again, I never would have gotten the shot, for me or my family.</p>

					<p>Believe me, this issue is being hotly followed by many major activism groups, with a view to presenting information to the people of Canada that makes them think twice about blindly subjecting themselves to government health initiatives without being properly informed.</p>
<p>Many people on this page believe that because they signed a waiver, they cannot sue for damages.  This is untrue.  The waiver is worthless without proper informed consent, which is the law in all our provinces.  While Glaxo was fully open in disclosure of risk factors, our government was not so forthcoming in what it used to &#8220;inform&#8221; us all.  Without informed consent, the government IS liable, and cannot rely on a bogus waiver.  This information is sourced to a very prominent legal authority, a professor of law at Western University, and an expert in liability law.  He says &#8220;A waiver isn&#8217;t worth the paper it shouldn&#8217;t be written on&#8221;, because there is NO WAY to provide proper informed consent.</p>
<p>We are still getting frequent comments here from people who are suffering from the shot for months afterward, with no relief and no improvement.  Some symptoms are very serious, and indicate long-term problems coming in future.  Some people&#8217;s lives have been ruined for their trust of authority.  Lives were lost, including those of newborns and the unborn&#8230; and in some cases, children lost a parent.</p>
<p>It is our hope that there is a lawyer and a brave victim who wants to start up a suit and turn it into a class action, whereby all Canadians who were damaged by this useless vaccine will gain access to compensation from a government that thought nothing of exposing people to such unknown, unquantifiable risks.  </p>
<p>If you have been vaccine-injured by any version of the H1N1 vaccine in Canada, and have contacted a lawyer, please share this page with your counsel, and remind him that there is no such thing as a waiver against this sort of damage!  DO NOT TAKE IT LYING DOWN.</p>
<p>If we can help you to further litigation against the Canadian government, we will do so, including by supplying the data from this page (privacy protected).  Never believe this issue has been forgotten.<br />
But Bill C-6 is coming back into Parliament, and we are preoccupied with fighting this bill which threatens to end health freedom in this nation, so if we seem distracted, it is with good reason.</p>
<p>Please stay tuned, keep reporting and updating as necessary.  Keep in touch with this site, and know that you are not alone!</p>

					<p>Please do not use this page as a discussion forum.  People are invited to report their adverse vaccine events here, but it is not a forum for personal interaction.  We will be making an overall report soon based on the reports left here, and discussions and other interactions would make that task very difficult.</p>

I had a lot of warm red swelling  on the side that got the H1N1<br />
it was the size of half a  baseball in my shoulder/ neck area, just above the collarbone<br />
It lasted for at least three weeks<br />
I had joint pain in my shoulder which lasted for three months and it still comes back quite often even now five months later<br />
I have never had any problem with that shoulder before the H1N1 shot</p>

					<p>The only reason I took the shot was because my family doctor and respirologist said it was absolutely necessary, given my Alpha one antitrypsin deficiency.  I have decreased lung capacity, and yet, inspite of this I have had not more than one cold in the year for the past 20 years or more.  After taking the shot, I was unable to move my head from side to side for at least three months.  Going to the chiro did not relieve this.  The muscles on either side of my neck and behind were swollen and stiff.  Added to that, i have had at least 5-6 colds and lung infections.  It seems like my immune system has been compromised.  I also experienced an anaphylactic reaction to some cheese I ate which contained yeast.  I was in acute care for this and am glad that I was near a hospital as my epipen had expired.  I am alergic to yeast, but the last time I had a reaction like this was in 1981!</p>

					<p>I am a mother of 4 , preschool teacher, and i am age 41.  On nov. 9th, 2009 i received the h1n1 vaccine at my doctor&#8217;s office.  I drove home(takes 15 minutes) and walked through the door to wave at my husband that i was home.  When i turned around I got dizzy and I told him I was going to lay down.  Right when I layed down I got burning in my head, my chest, and my legs.  My face became swollen and I lost my motor skills and was having trouble breathing.  My husband got me to the emergency room and by this time i was having uncontrollable shaking.  He was not allowed to bring my son in the emergency room so he stepped out to call a neighbor .  At that time the nurses labeled me as anxious and treated me as such.  Since then, I have had numbness in head, spine, and legs,.  I could not talk for a while and still get tongue twisted at times.  I looked like I had a stroke on right side , eye drooping, and mouth, and hand for a while.  I have been extremely dizzy, walked into walls, forgot how to drive or operate a car, etc.,  I have had pain in heart, along with numerous other symptoms.  I now have burning in head and pain like it is bruised.  My thinking skills are slow and vision blurred.  I feel like my system is continually being attacked and I can&#8217;t get treatment like plasma pheresis , etc,. because i have been told since there is no known name such as GBS that they can&#8217;t just treat me.  I feel like it is going into an autoimmune disease and am trying to prevent this and have been fighting for my life for me and for my children.  If you know anyone that can help or whom has more information please contact me at this email.  Helpless mother who just wanted to be well and now I have ruined my life.</p>

					<p>There is hope for regaining your health, Beth ( and others )&#8230; several protocols exist to cleanse much of this toxicity from your body.  Check out the website of Dr. Rashid Buttar, who treated Washington Redskins cheerleader Desiree Jennings and has restored much of her health , which continues to improve.  Also Dr. Russell Blaylock.  There are many others. An Osteopath is your best bet, but do get naturopathic help, as the medical community has very little to offer you, but the natural community has a great deal.  Get on the computer and do your research, and you will find a pile of information that you need to understand.<br />
Also, people need to realize that the waiver that you were asked to sign did not prove informed consent, as you are allowed under law in all provinces.  SEE A LAWYER.  The Canadian Government said it would compensate vaccine-injuries, then tried its best to avoid that liability with its waiver.  But that waiver may not be worth the paper it&#8217;s written on, so explore ALL your rights!</p>

					<p>I have posted here several times.  My H1N1 vaccination was received Oct. 26 and my arm problems persist.  MRI is scheduled for May 3.  My Adverse Effect Report has been filed which everyone here should have done as well.<br />
Yesterday I phoned my contact at PHAC (Public Health Agency of Canada).  I informed her I have no improvement and I am extremely unhappy that my whole quality of life has been altered because of the H1N1 vaccine.<br />
She said they were still trying to determine what was causing the arm pain to some people and thought the injection was given too high and injured the deltoid muscle, but that might not be the case in everyone.  I asked what they would do to compensate me financially for both my expenses and for pain and suffering.  She said it would have to come from the province, not federally.  I asked why?  Her answer:   she said she knew the US was doing it and that our government was late in getting into it – that was her explanation.  She was going to email the Minister of Health in Alberta and also bring it up at their next meeting at the end of this month.<br />
I asked why there was nothing in the Adverse Effect PHAC report about long term arm pain – her answer was that until they could determine what had, or was causing it, they would post it there.<br />
I asked her to check if my Adverse Effect had been filed and she told me she did not have the ability to look it up and to check locally.   On January 21 when I talked to her she did look it up by birth date and said it had not been filed yet.  I believe she is not being truthful with me &#8211; one time she can look it up and then the next time she can&#8217;t ???<br />
I did call the Health Unit responsible filing the Adverse Effect report and they confirmed it was filed.<br />
My arm pain symptoms are:<br />
•	Numbness and tingling in hand<br />
•	Shock feeling going up arm and when dressing or putting arm in coat sleeve<br />
•	Crawling pain in upper under arm<br />
•	Severe jolting pain on top of upper arm<br />
•	Feels like muscles are twisted<br />
•	Feels like large rubber band is pulled out as far as it can be<br />
•	Shoulder pain<br />
•	Pain to hold anything heavy, can&#8217;t open fridge door, or open and close car door<br />
•	Temperature difference in each arm<br />
•	Swelling in forearm<br />
•	Can not lift my arm or turn to the side very far<br />
All of this for over five months &#8211; sometimes I rock with the pain and even have had a few crying jags in private.<br />
I am sorry this is such a lengthy post, but I am angry about the vaccine, upset at my doctor who isn&#8217;t doing anything, upset because I have to wait so long for an MRI, and so terribly tired of the pain.<br />
I want a cure and I want my life back &#8211; just like the rest of you.</p>

					<p>How long do these H1N1 side effects last?  I got the shot, and I been feeling tired, weak, headache vomiting and I been getting chills and hot flashes.  Before I got the shot I was fine, and now after I got the shot I feel weak.  I got the shot in at the end of January and it&#8217;s not March.</p>

					<p>My girlfriend received the H1N1 vaccination shot in mid November.  She is 49 in excellent health.  She had a bad flu a couple of weeks prior to the shot but she did not seek medical attention at the time so not certian if H1N1.  A few days after receiving the shot she development flu like symptoms with a bad cough and mild small rashes over her body but these symptoms subsided after several days. A couple weeks after the shot she developed a sore throat.  She saw her doctor at the time and she (her doctor) said she had a swollen Lympth node but not to worry abou it but  prescribed nothing for it.  The soreness has been getting progressively worse since and pain seems to have migrated to her whole neck and upper back.  She went to see her doctor again last week about it and she advised my gf to check back with her in a few weeks but sent her for a regular blood work check up, still awaiting results.  I know of a couple of other peole who developed similar symptoms (sore throat and neck) after the shot but they feel, as does my gf, that they are not getting the required medical attention from the their doctors.</p>

					<p>I am a 56 year-old female and received the H1N1 flu shot in Sarnia, Ontario in October or November when it came open to the general public.   The shot was uneventful and I had no immediate side effects other than a sore arm at the injection site for about a week.   I am wondering if there are any reported gastro-intestinal side effects.   I take anti-depressant medication that has caused me to suffer chronic constipation for years.  As a result of that I eat a very high fibre diet and work hard to keep things moving.  Despite this, I had BMs about once a week.   In the last 4 months things have changed dramatically.  I have gas, gurgling bowels, and BMs every second day.  This is just not normal for me.   I am only just now wondering if the flu shot might be a factor.    I am most definitely not complaining about becoming &#8220;regular&#8221;, but again, it&#8217;s not normal for me.</p>

					<p>hi there,</p>
<p>I had the flu shot and the h1n1 flu vaccine last november 12, 2010, since then i had hot flushes, got flu that lasted 2 weeks, that I never had before. Last Feb 2010, my vision gets blurry. Eventhough I take a nice sleep and rest. I had joint pains and always feel tired all the time. Sometimes I feel like my left body is paralyzed. A little twist of my body seemed to be too affecting to me, like my bones will separate with each other. This vaccine only gives pain and autoimmune diseases to me, I should have never had this. It ruins my whole life. I hope we can sue the government!</p>

					<p>I received the H1N1 on Nov 16th and from moment it went into my system I felt very strange and disoriented by supper time I had a hard time swallowing and I just felt sick. The next day I was still having a hard time swallowing and I was short of breathe. I have asthma so I took my  puffers then I realized I couldn&#8217;t lift my arm when I looked at it was swollen, red from the elbow up to shoulder and hot to touch so I figured it was an allergic reaction so I took benadryl which helped the throat because it actually was getting smaller and the heat of the arm and of course my breathing with the help of my puffers. The next day I was getting together with my sister to do somethings but I had time for a long walk by the time my sister picked me up my face was swelling with red burning welts on it so I took benadryl and called the Doctor by the time I got there my welts were gone because of the benadryl but I felt disorienteed my lips were now swelling along with the face so he gave me peridisone 50mg to stop the swelling and I was told to take 2 benadryl every 4-6 hrs until all symptoms stopped well I am still on antihistames and it is March. I have swelling face and/or lips, welts and rashes if I over due which is doing light housework or a 10 min walk and that is only if I am well enough because I have just gotten sicker and sicker; Light-headedness, dizzy, legs feel like rubber and I can&#8217;t walk very far, feel disoriented, tingling in the legs feet  arms and hands, sore muscles and spasms especially at night which makes hard to fall asleep and then periodically I am awaken with charlie horses in my leg or feet, my throat at times still feels like it is narrowing and it is difficult to swallow I can not swallow large pills and the small one also get stuck when the throat is bad so I crush the pills because the pills would lodge in my throat and I couldn&#8217;t drink or talk so I dislodged them with the fingers down the throat trick not recommended unless no other choice,and I occasionally stil have shortness of breathe, I still get a headache which is off and on since Nov , I am pale until the red welts/rash show up. Thank God the antihistamines help but they gave me an epi pen just in case . I saw and allergist , he says no allergies but that the shot did interacted with my medications because I do have many different disease ( asthma, arthristis, fibermyolgia, over-active bladder, acid reflux, chronic laryngitis)  and he believes it is angioedema with anaphyaxtoid symptoms but it doesn&#8217;t explain all of my symptoms and why I am getting worse. The Doctor knows I am sick but has no clue to why so I have to see my rheumatalogist to see if she can figure it out. I am 54 yr old woman who most days feels 90 and can&#8217;t do very much and if I do I am lying down on the couch or in bed for the rest of the day except to eat which I do even though I don&#8217;t want to most days or nauseated and sometimes stomach cramps no fun at all.</p>

					<p>I received the H1N1 vac. on Nov. 3.09 and on Nov. 9.09 in Luxor Egypt I developed fever blisters (must have had fever), severe pain in the front and back of my left  chest, shoulder and neck.   Also, about 1 hour after receiving the vac., where it was injected became very inflamed and swollen and It stayed swollen about the size of a golf ball for 3 weeks.  I went to Hosiptal in Egypt, they did tests re heart and chest and said I had inflamation of my chest muscles.  Approximately 3 days later when I decided ti venture out for a while I had severe shortness of breath when I walked more than 1/4 of a block or a I walk fastly or go up the stairs.  This still continues to this day (April 1, 2010).  I have gone to a cardiologist and he has done extensive testing for my hearat and lungs and I am told I am in perfect health and they do not know what this is.  I was fine before this and never had this problem.  It is making me miserable.  I cann&#8217;t even enjoy dancing and to put it midly, I am really upset about this and I just don&#8217;t know what to do now.  I am in the process of arguing with my family dr now &#8211; what are we going to do now?  There is something wrong.  They even tried a puffer &#8211; does not help.  Thank you.</p>

					<p>Hi, I received my H1N1 and seasonal flu shots on Feb 4 around 3pm in Vancouver, BC. It was provided to public school employee for free.</p>
<p>I worked in a school and my job requires constant interaction with people. I am a 33 year old female with excellent physical condition. I&#8217;m very conciouse about my body and I eat healthy. I&#8217;m about 5&#8217;1&#8243; and 100lb. I am not on any medication (not even the pill). I was able to fight off cold/flu type sympton by my own system naturally even during the peak of H1N1 outbreak at my school.  All of these didn&#8217;t get me into any flu like sympton until I got the H1N1 vaccine&#8230;</p>
<p>1) I noticed I will have flu like sympton almost every other week. When it gets worse, I got this horrible migranes that have never happened to me before. (I didn&#8217;t even know that&#8217;s called migrane until I read the above posts noting the piercing headache sympton)</p>
<p>2) Constantly feeling tired or not getting enough sleep even though I have more than 8 hours of sleep. Before I only need 6 hours to feel fully charged.</p>
<p>3) I noticed increased virginal discharge and the color turned white/yellow. It used to be clear and not as much.</p>
<p>4) Allergies occured more often then before: itchiness, rush, coughing due to irritated throat, sore throat. Sometimes lead to flu like sympton.</p>
<p>5) I had some spotting and feeling some pain during ovulation. It usually happens when my body is in weaker state.</p>
<p>6) Join pains that comes and goes, feels kind of like a milder form of migrane for joins. I never had that before the shots either.</p>
<p>I kind of feel my body is trying to fight off the virus so I&#8217;m getting more white blood cells produced. I am also feeling the virus might as well distrupted my female hormone somehow and caused some PMS like sympton. My metabolism became slower and I feel bloated all the time.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to take the shot before but I took it anyway since I was going on a trip a week after the shots. I regret that so much now and I hope these can go away in the next couple weeks.</p>

					<p>I just happened to land on this site and am so glad to have found it! Worried at the same time as well. I&#8217;m in my early 50&#8242;s, female and noted like some others here that I have never been so sick back to back with colds and flus, off and on, have slight fevers and headaches off and on as well, basically I&#8217;ve never felt so lowsy in all my life like I have since the shot. I didn&#8217;t have any severe reactions, just a tad nauseated and feverish for a day. In general I have enjoyed good health all my life. I have NEVER had any flu shots either, but last November took the H1N1 because of elderly parents. I believe that this was a HUGE mistake!!  I can&#8217;t get enough sleep and after sleeping 8 or 10 hours I still need to have naps during the day, I feel exhauseted all the time and no longer enjoy the energy level I had before the H1N1 shot.  It is now April 2010 and I had the shot in November 2009. You can bet I will let as many people as possible know about this site, I&#8217;m TICKED. All I can hope for is that I will start feeling better and get back to the good health I enjoyed last year. My daughter and her husband have 100% my support NO H1N1 for the grandson &#8212;  NO WAY!!! and NO!!! for my other children!!!!!</p>

Some (not all) of your symptoms remind me of thyroid symptoms&#8230; May want to check if this has affected your thyroid at all. Let us know if it has. If so, that makes me all the more thankful I don&#8217;t get shots like this &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve been hypo-thyroid since infancy and wouldn&#8217;t want 1 more thing interfering w/ it.</p>

					<p>I&#8221;m 28 years old and live in Nova Scotia and in very good health. Many people have tried to persuade me to receive the H1N1 shot back in the fall. I refused the shot even though it caused much anger and debate between family and co workers who had readily and blindly jumped on the vaccine bandwagon. Most of these people who I know that received the shot had gotten sick anyhow. I on the other hand never became ill or even caught a cold at all throughout the fall and winter.I kept myself well by always washing my hands ( I rarely use antibacterial cleansers as they are damaging to my skin)taking vitamins and walking on a regular basis, eating lots of garlic and onions ( vanity and paranoia of bad breath aside, my health is more important), eating lots of oatmeal bread, citrus fruits, berries, broccoli, asparagus and swiss chard etc. I cut out all microwave, canned and frozen meals that are high in sodium, chemical preservatives and anything that contains MSG (monosodium glutamate), soda pop of any kind and drank lots of filtered water and fruit juice. I feel extremely lucky to have trusted my instincts on refusing a vaccine that we do not really understand and what it truthfully contains as ingredients. I have lost faith in our health system and feel as though it now lacks integrity. Apparently, a quick fix to solve or prevent impending illness has caused more problems, some even unrelated to the actual flu alone. We should have been properly educated on how to maintain a fully functioning immune system because it is our natural immune system that helps fight off illness. Also, I find it very unusual that pregnant women were vaccinated with a flu vaccine that has very little testing considering it is taboo to consume alcohol, smoke cigarettes, take pain medicines and many over and under the counter drugs in case of fetal deformation, death and other possible problems.</p>

					<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I posted awhile back. Got the vacc on Dec 11 (I will never forget that night) and 2 weeks later was delivered to hospital via ambulance due to extreme illness/autoimmune reaction to vacc  &#8211; I just became progressively more ill from the day I got the shot. Have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy as a result of some type of autoimmune/or toxicity in the vacc (unconcluded). Have all the same symptoms described in many of the posts &#8211; lots neurological and very scary symptoms and peripheral nerve issues &#8211; numness/tingling/vibrating/burning/electrical shock/bug bite feelings with overall systemic &#8216;sick&#8217; feeling &#8211; no appetite/upset tummy/exhaustion/major migraine headaches that last for days&#8230;etc. Apparently the vacc can cause an irritation of the peripheral nerves throughout our body causing a very unpleasant symptom list. Am being followed by a doc/neurologist both whom said this will end in time, that everyone is different and it can take a longer time for some to heal than others. </p>
<p>For those who need online support there is a community at medhelp dot org &#8211; under immunizations and vaccines &#8211; there are many chapters to read as we have all formed an online family to deal with this lonely isolating illness and work together for recovery. I would not have been able to cope without sites like this and at medhelp.</p>
<p>Thanks &#8211; please visit us at medhelp/immunizations and vaccines &#8220;Tingling after Swine Flu vaccine Chapter Two&#8221; There is support for those of you who need it. </p>
<p>Thanks for posting this,</p>
<p>Cathy</p>

					<p>Hi There, </p>
<p>I was glancing through my received posts again and came across yours. This post is me to a nutshell. I am 39 years old and had the H1N1 Vaccine in November and am still getting hives, which I had never had before in my life before this. I have tried everything to no avail. Good luck because I know I need it.</p>

					<p>Hello,</p>
<p>On October 30, 2009 I received the H1N1 vaccine in Newfoundland, Canada (local community withheld). Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine I began to experience sever swelling on the palms my feet which lasted several days. As I work rotationally at a remote location I returned to work only to be plagued with swelling of the palms of my hands and pressure hives to my arms and shoulders. I received medical treatment from the medical aid at my work site in the form of oral antihistamines which however did not help. Upon returning home three weeks later I continued to experience sever hives and sought treatment from my family doctor who diagnosed me with Vasculitis and continued to prescribe several oral antihistamines. My symptoms however worsened, I was unable to return to work and my family doctor prescribed heavy doses of Prendisone. This was a very  difficult time since I had very sever reactions when trying to come off the steroids including episodes where I experienced swelling in the mouth and throat and sever heartburn like pain in which case I went to emergeny at the local hospital. Several months passed as I experienced the side effects of the drug and sever symptoms continued to show up when the Prendisone was removed. I still could not return to work,as it is a remote location, my company offered to expedite an appointment with a dermatologist which I accepted. In the mean time my family doctor began a very slow weaning prescription of Prendisone as the dermatologist began me on antihistamines again. To date I am currently on 4 different antihistamines and still experiencing symptoms every 2nd or 3rd day, because I work in an extremely remote location and the severity of some my episodes I am unable to return to work there. At the request of my company based on the advise of the thier doctor  I have returned on modified duties to my employers local office for a reduced wage even though some of the antihistamines are drowsy medication, (In fact one drug has as one of it&#8217;s many uses is a sleeping pill!) and I have a 50+ km commute both ways each day . It is now April 12, 2010. I have endured much financial loss, physical pain and emotional stress since receiving this vaccine.  I have recently learned that public health who administered the vaccine to me has been instructed to stop and doctors have been requested to provide reports of any adverse reactions to it. </p>
<p>Just for completeness I received: H1N1 Adjuvant, trade name Arepanrix,  manufactured by Glaxosmithkline, dose #1 @ 0.5 mls, route: 1m ,site: LA. I am a 38 year old male Caucasian with no prior allergy to eggs, and was very healthy and in good  physical condition. I had received many vaccines in the past for seasonal flue, yellow fever, hepatitis ect. with no reaction at all.</p>
<p>I would very much like to know of any similar cases to mine.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

					<p>Hi Eugene</p>
<p>I read your post and nedless to say, your story is as if I had written it myself. I posted just prior to you.<br />
I am from Nova Scotia, 38yr old male. </p>
<p>Without getting into too much detail, I have been dealing with chronic pressure related  hives for 5 mths since I received the vaccine at the end of Nov 2009. They are nonresponsive to the antihistimine treatment of 80mg of Reactine, 600 mg of zantac and 10mg singualir , all DAILY . Most recently added Doxepin in a topical form which made the situation worse-much worse. There are times that the swelling and pain and itch in my palms, feet and forearms make it near impossible to function.</p>
<p>Today- I have returned to another cycle of Steriods. 3rd time on a &#8220;run&#8221; of Prednisone which is the only thing that provides relief. It is like a vicious cycle. Soon as I stop, they return. </p>
<p>I too have been severly impacted by the affects of the outbreaks;on many levels.</p>
<p>I have taken vaccines in the past, with no issues.  I have all Arepanrix, Antigen and Adjuvant numbers on file which are different than yours. Our outcomes however are undeniably similar.</p>

					<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>Yes, I read your post just after posting mine and had to stop and think, &#8220;Have I posted here before?&#8221;. </p>
<p>In regards to the Prednisone I had to come off it very slowly otherwise the hives were terrible. 5mg less per week and even then they were bad, but life on Prednisone is miserable; sleeplessness, weight gain, moody, so I was happy to try to get off it. Good luck with it.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we are not the only ones talking here; on my last visit to the dermatologist I was expecting to start on Doxepin as per the plan outlined to me, but instead nothing changed, I found that courious since I&#8217;m still having random hives and pressure hives. Then I read your post that Doxepin made your symptoms worse which leads me to think our doctors might be in consultation, this is good since it might have spared me some pain. However I aso see this as more evidence that the vaccine is responsible for all this, and still no one is admitting it! This waiver that we signed before recieving the vaccine did not make us aware of such long term effects. Surely there must be something we could do legally, the federal government very clearly stated that it would take legal responsibility for complications from the vaccine. I rely heavily on my salary and this has very nearly put me in the poor house. I have contacted a local lawyer who said my first course of action would be to have a third part doctor review my case at a cost to me, money I just don&#8217;t have right now. This is why I&#8217;m on this site, my doctors are baffled and this has had drastic effects on my career and personal life. I&#8217;m thinking if more and more people come forward with legitimate cases then some form of rectification might come out of it. If nothing else validate our cases since I&#8217;m sure my employer thinks I&#8217;m just milking some phantom illness, which is killing my future with the company. Fact is I&#8217;m scared, I have no idea what might set off another sever reaction where my airways begin to swell and close off and for that to happen in the remote location where I work could very easily be the end of me!</p>

					<p>Eugene, we are attempting to keep this column as a record, rather than a forum, but I want to address your most salient point: The waiver you signed does NOT indemnify the government for the exact reason you state, that you were not properly informed of the risks and dangers prior to allowing the shot, as you rightly complain.  </p>
<p><strong>Please consult a lawyer</strong>, and I am suggesting here and now that a class action suit would be most appropriate, given the numbers of postings here.  </p>
<p>The suffering on this board alone, which represents, I&#8217;m sure, only a small fraction of those injured, is ample cause. </p>
<p>In essence, the waiver meant &#8220;You agree that you have been adequately informed of the risks and benefits of this vaccine, trust us, we didn&#8217;t leave anything out.&#8221;  But they did, and they know they did.</p>
<p>So do you.</p>
<p>Our government assumed liability; it should be prepared to back up its guarantees. And when government harms citizens, it must undo its harm without a whimper, because it was never given the mandate to hurt us.</p>

					<p>I would be 100% behind a class action lawsuit against the big pharma/govement and provinicial goverment who deployed this vaccine and did not by any means discuss the massive impact it could have on my life. I am 4 months and 4 days post vaccine and am dealing with continuing neurological symptoms and have been put through the mill as a result. My life has become completely altered not to mention the expense, emotional stress on my family and the post trauma I am dealing with when I remember who sick I was in the hospital &#8211; I have NEVER been through anyhting like this and would love to have this ordeal brought to justice for everyone who is affected by the reaction.</p>
<p>How do we deploy on somehting like this? What is involved in filing a class action law suit? What if a bunch of us got togethr and sued the big pharma &#8211; they made millions off our misery! Not fair. We derserve to be heard. I wish a journalist/investigative reporter would cover this and demand that the public know the truth about this adverse reactions numbers &#8211; Fifth Estate/Market Place, where are you??? CBC find out about us! There are so many who have been made so ill! The good peple of Canada deserve to be heard and compensated for their loss of work, reduced work hours, tests, lost time!<br />
_VERY FRUSTRATED_ for all of us</p>
<p>Wishing you all health and healing.</p>

					<p>Sick and tired of my two children being sick and tired, I sought answers and was directed here.</p>
<p>While I was away on business at the end of October, my ex-husband and ex-mother-in-law (who were watching my children) asked if I wanted to have the children vaccinated against H1N1.  My immediate (gut) reaction was &#8216;No&#8217;, but I was asked to think about it, and against my better judgment (stupid me! Mothers:  NEVER GO AGAINST YOUR INTUITION WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CHILDREN!!), I finally consented and on October 28, 2009, my children, who were at the time aged 4 and 18 months, received the regular H1N1 shot (We are located in Ottawa, Ontario) They got half of it in October and half in November because of their age.  Four days later, my youngest spiked a fever.  The fever broke, but came back in the middle of the night a day later (103F), and she was rushed to CHEO and advised that she had strep throat.  She was given antibiotics.  A week later my eldest got sick.  She had bronchitis.</p>
<p>To me, this triggered alarm bells.  My children are VERY rarely sick.  In fact, since she was born, the youngest had required antibiotics only once and for an ear infection.</p>
<p>At the beginning of December, both girls fell sick AGAIN.  The eldest didn&#8217;t require medication (she had flu-like symptoms), but the youngest had conjunctivitis, a bronchial infection and an ear infection and was once again put on antibiotics and ointment for her eyes.  A week after finishing her antibiotic treatment, she was sick again and I was told she had strep.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas, my eldest had to be put on antibiotics for an ear infection.</p>
<p>I should make you all aware that I did NOT receive the H1N1 shot, but I got a regular flu shot (it is mandatory as I volunteer at an Old Age Home).  I have NOT been sick in a very long time.  </p>
<p>In January, I fell ill, and so did my eldest (again)  I figured it was a flu, so I went to see a walk-in Doctor as my own was not available.  He swabbed both of us and my eldest had strep, but I tested negative for strep.  He asked me (this conversation is VERBATIM):</p>
<p>Dr:  Have you had your H1N1 shot?<br />
Me:  No<br />
Dr: Oh, well it is probably that then.</p>
<p>I must have looked at him like he had two heads, because he followed with &#8220;Come back in a few days if you aren&#8217;t feeling better&#8221;</p>
<p>I managed to get better on my own, but my children were not so fortunate.  </p>
<p>At the end of February, the girls were sick again so I took them both to the doctor.  The eldest had fluid in her right lung and the youngest in her left (pneumonia).  They were put on another antibiotic, and they recovered.</p>
<p>In March, the youngest was diagnosed with an ear nfection and put on antibiotics (yet AGAIN), the eldest got sick but recovered quickly on her own.  Both girls had fevers above 101, and threw up the first day.  They rested and recovered.</p>
<p>In about an hour, I will be on my way to see the doctor again.  The girls are both sick again.  This time, no fever, they are just tired, congested runny noses, coughing and wheezing.  </p>
<p>I am in immense pain considering the condition these poor children have been in since receiving the shot.  I blame myself because this was MY DECISION.  </p>
<p>My father told me that GSK did NOT test this shot before administering it, and yet they have a pages long disclosure saying that they can&#8217;t be held responsible if anything out of the ordinary happens to you.</p>
<p>How much longer do my children have to be sick for?  Will they be sick every single month for the rest of their life?</p>
<p>We live in a clean city.  We live in a clean (relatively new, built in 2005) home.  We have a HEPA air filter installed.  I&#8217;ve had contractors come into the house to check for spores, mold, etc.  They have all found nothing.  Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t make sense that in the presence of these things that only the children would get sick.  </p>
<p>The ONLY difference between myself and my children is their exposure to the H1N1 vaccine.  </p>
<p>Feel free to get in touch with me if this goes class-action.  I will be more than happy to provide adequate documentation of the state of my children&#8217;s health before and after this vaccine.</p>

					<p>all stressed out about side affects from the h1n1 vaccine.i am starting worried that i am having side affects .<br />
i am a health 57 year old man.i decided to get the vaccine when 3-4 people i work with got the h1n1 flu.so it went to my family doctor in mid november and got the h1n1 vaccine,with the doctor telling me he took it himself.<br />
i was glad to see that it did not get a sore arm from the shot ,cause every one i talk to said they got a sore arm from the shot.earlier in the year i was having some Gastroenteritis problems and was taking  prescription pills for my gas problem,but stop taking them cause they seem not work.then on dec 15 ,3 weeks after i had my h1n1 vaccinne i started to have gas proplems again so it took a pill that i used to take before with no side affects.well to my suprise the pill that i had no problems before,i ended up with a very severe itching attack all over my body,it was so bad that i was scratching so hard that i started to leave bad scratching marks all over my body and my throat was hurting,this last for a hour,then finally restored it self to a mild itch for the rest of the day.<br />
a week later i took a ddifferent gas pill i used to take before my h1n1 vaccine and again the severe itching attack.<br />
so 2 weeks later again a different gas pill i used to take before and again the same ithcing attack so i told my doctor and i had no idea why this was happening.so now do not dare take any of those pill.<br />
about mid feb i started having itchy watery eyes and itching tingling pinching feeling all over my body but mild.<br />
again my doctor told it was probely a allergies,which i never had my whole life.so i went for a allergie test and had a small reaction to eggs even though i have been eating eggs all my life and never had a reaction to eggs before in fact i would eat 3 to 4 eggs a week no problem. well guess whats in the vaccine in the h1n1 &#8220;EGGS&#8221;</p>

					<p>My doctor got blood work done today for arthritis because of my joint aches and knee swelling.I  am going to Dr.Gannage in Markham next week. An autoimmune disease could have developed for me.<br />
I also got medicine for angular cheilitis (cracked corners of mouth)  which I suffered since getting the flu shot in Dec. My fear is it could be Sjogren&#8217;s Syndrome but time will tell.</p>

					<p>I am 53 yr old female.  Got the H1N1 shot Nov 5/09.  No reaction at the time.  I am not sure if the following is related to the shot or not.  Several weeks later developed tingling in head.  Dec 12th  developed very stiff neck which after 3 days developed into chronic daily headaches.  One month later developed severe burning and tingling on top of head.  Discovered very small lesion like sores on the scalp.  Felt like my head was hit with a baseball bat and waves of my head feeling very wobbly and feeling like I might pass out.   Extreme weakness and tired at times as well as dizziness;  all coming on in waves throughout the day.  It feels like I have been poisoned.  I actually thought I might not come out of this, however,  I am recovering.  The  waves of feeling the symptoms have been subsiding daily.  Went to emerg several times; they say nothing wrong with me.  Not sure if the H1N1 has mercury in it but I am waiting for results from blood work that is testing mercury level.  I am also taking iron supplements.<br />
Some of my symptoms are those of others, so not sure what to think.  Thank you all.</p>

					<p>I am a 47 yr old male, have always been healthy with no family diseases or hereditary issues. I rec&#8217;d the H1n1 vaccine in Oct 09 and have had ongoing problems ever since. It was aprox 2 days after the shot that I really started to feel poorly. I woke up with a very stiff neck and then realized that my shoulders and hips were also affected. I made a appointment with my Dr. who asked for blood work and after receiving the lab report advised me that they felt I had contracted a auto immune disease called polymyalgia rheumatica,I was prescribed heavy dosages of prednisone 60 mg. then tapering off to ween my system from this drug. It worked well until it was stopped then all the symptoms came back. Then I was referred to a Rheumatologist who determined that it was more likely rheumatoid arthritis (RA) although the markers for the RA were not all there. During discussions with the Rheumy she feels that the disease (RA) was started by the H1N1 shot. As my body began to fight against the introduction of a foreign invader (h1N1), but since really nothing was there but the shot, the immune system began to attack itself. I am again on prednisone (weening off)  and methytrexate a arthritis drug which slows the immune system from attacking itself. I am self employed and do need to work to live so it is a daily struggle in that the disease has no affected my hands, wrists and fingers severely as well as many other joints and I have daily chronic pain. I feel angered in that I was not warned of this type of side effect could occur and that I may have to live with this for the rest of my life. I for one will never advocate the flu shot of any kind. Anybody else end up with this type of problem? Thanks..</p>

					<p>Hello Martin,<br />
Kristie Tait got her news on CTV. I think you should get in touch with them too and then contact Siskinds.<br />
I want us to do this to preent others who can be affected. Squalene is probably the cause.<br />
We do not want them to continue using vaccines with that adjuvant, else we will have a generation of chronically ill people.</p>
<p>Everyone who hase been diagnosed with somehting or the other should get in touch with them.<br />

					<p>Got both regular flu shot and the H1N1 shot the same day in November 2009. I am female, age 65 with fairly good health, on meds for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Shortly after getting the vaccines, started having tingling/tickling sensations all long my left side, head to ankle.My physician referred me to a neurologist and he ordered a dopplar imaging and MRI of my brain to check for possible mini stroke. Both tests showed my brain to be in great condition and the arteries in my neck unblocked. The coondition continues and now seeking the cause (April 25, 2010). Definitely not related to side effects of my current meds. It has become extremely irritating, keeping me awake at night and occurring unexpected at all times of day. The only unusual thing health-related to the start of my problem was my flu shot.</p>

					<p>Nelson, BC.  Received H1N1 vaccine Oct 29th.  Within a week my hand started to go numb, and through the next few weeks my whole body.  Up and down, coming and going symptoms ever since.<br />
List of various symptoms that come and go (for the past 6 months)<br />
Numbness, mostly hands and face<br />
Muscle exhaustion, burning sensation<br />
Fatigue spells, come and go throughout the day<br />
Brainfog, and dizzy spells<br />
Muscle cramping, tightening, contracting on their own<br />
Limbs will have the &#8216;fall asleep sensation&#8217;<br />
Memory loss, shortterm<br />
Joints will ache, or one (can&#8217;t open jars or doors one day, and then I can without any pain)<br />
This can strike whenever it all wants, seems to be no rhyme or reason.  I think I am getting better though, seems to be less bad days and the good days seem to be getter better.  I am hopeful of a full recovery.  I started reading and following the advice in the Nourishing Traditions book by Sally Fallon, so maybe with such a clean diet I am noticing some improvments, or maybe it is just time&#8230;I just want to be well again.<br />
My heart goes to all with life interuptions due to this.</p>

					<p>Dee &#8211;  Thank you very much for supporting us and pushing for our story to be heard. I hope it is and I would join any class action lawsuit that would bring this issue to light &#8211; especially if the WHO is being investigated re: buy off/kick backs to declare a pandemic. </p>
<p>The thinking or working diagnosis is that my immune system attacked the peripheral nerves in my body &#8211; causing months of extremely debilitating illness that continues. Many others have experienced the same thing as per this and other websites and I feel like a part of my life has been destroyed because I was doing the right thing!</p>
<p>I am nearing the 5 month post vacc mark &#8211; I have been told that it could take a year or longer to recover. What if I can&#8217;t work? What if I have long term health issues? Then what? And to think that when people would say that it seemed to come to market too quickly, and they would not take it due to the &#8217;76 US fallout/GBS debacle,  I MYSELF said&#8230;&#8221;they have perfected this vaccine over the years &#8211; there is no way they would bring something to market that would cause anyone harm.&#8221;  HA. What a joke &#8211; Hope all the big pharma sales execs who made a fortune and huge bonuses have a great time pricing new vacation homes and yachts, while so many Canadians remain debilitated, sick and suffering. </p>
<p>I am sickened by the course of events in our country and very sorry to those who are suffering over this &#8211; it&#8217;s not  fair.</p>
<p>I wish they could read these posts!!!</p>

					<p>I am a 48 year old female living in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.  In October I received the H1N1 vaccine at the same time as the regular flu vaccine at my workplace.  For several days prior to receiving the vaccines I had general body aches, which seemed to have subsided the day before I got the vaccines.</p>
<p>The injection site from the H1N1 vaccine started to itch that evening.  It was red, hot and swollen.  The itching continued in severity for 2-3 weeks and eventually subsided.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within 24 hours of getting the vaccine my knee joint on the same side as the H1N1 injection site started to ache.  I could not then, nor now pinpoint exactly where the pain is except that it is the back of my knee.  If I stand for any period of time, it locks and I cannot walk .  If I sit for any period of time, I am unable to walk for several minutes when I stand up.  When I lay down I have to have pillows under it to keep it slightly bent, or I cannot walk when I get up.  If I do any walking on it, it gets worse.  Sometimes when I first get out of bed and try to walk, I find the joint almost feels &#8220;loose&#8221; and I feel like my leg is going to go out from under me.  It is now the end of April and the pain still continues.  </p>
<p>I had an xray in November that showed nothing.  I took a prescription anti inflammatory medication for 2 weeks initially which had no effect.  I have tried icing it which only makes it worse.  I have tried massage with no effect.</p>
<p>The only thing that seems to give me any relief is a hot bath and soaking for a long time.  However, I find it very difficult and painful getting into and out of the bathtub.</p>
<p>I am beginning to wonder if and when this will ever subside.  I have suggested to my doctor that I think it is somehow linked to the vaccination which he doesn&#8217;t respond to.  </p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions, I would welcome them.  I also know of 2 other co-workers who had the vaccination at the same time who are suffering similar symptoms.</p>

					<p>Hi, I initially posted April 23rd.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know if people are experiencing their symptoms as waxing and waning as time goes on with reduced frequency and intensity.</p>
<p>i.e.  are the symptoms constant or do they come and go throughout the day.</p>
<p>My symptoms initially were constant and daily.  Over time I noticed the frequency and intensity has been reduced to every other day, then every third day and now appearing every 5 days and last the whole day.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />

					<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>Yes, I am almost 5 months post vacc and can agree that that is also my experience &#8211; I have gone from being bedridden for 4 weeks to very slowly emerging out of this nightmare at a snails pace. However, it can come back out of the blue and the only words that come to mind are: Sudden Onset. I can become very symptomatic after having a few days with reduced symptoms.</p>
<p>It is a baffling and strange illness.</p>

					<p>To Anna/Cathy,</p>
<p>I concur.  This comes and goes, quick onset&#8230;lasting hours to days.  I can go almost two weeks with minimal symptoms and then no rhyme or reason &#8216;BANG&#8217; down for a few days.  It seems like my better days are continually getting better, and the bad days are not as bad as the other bad days.  So I do notice some improvments.<br />
 It is just hard with it being so unpredictable, I was planning a trip to see some family next week and I have postponed it.  I was good for a couple of weeks, and yesterday was aweful&#8230;so it scared me.  I can&#8217;t be on the road with two small children and then have my body give up on me, and worse for brain fog to set in.  </p>
<p>I too would be willing and interested in filing a suit too, so count me in if anyone gets the class action started.  This has interupted my quality of life every single day for six months now.  All because I too thought I was doing what was best to protect the population.<br />

					<p>I have made inquiries into possible pro bono work. I am doing research into the law firm that won the first US vaccine injury lawsuit and how it all went down. I am thinking strategcally regarding the message that I want to send out: Canadians need to know the adverse reactions that come with this vaccine. Canadians need to make informed decisions. The goverment needs to know that these health crises are happening to their people who have elected them. Big pharma needs to address this &#8211; I want to hear them address this and provide answers.  They are not even required to tell us what is in the vacc besides the dead virus &#8211; you would be surprised and grossed out by what we have had injected into our bodies &#8211; there was no pandemic, but there was a hell of alot of marketing.</p>
<p>But who would want to take them on? Who will be the David to their Goliath? My guess is not many lawyers would do this as a class action &#8211; big pharma is so protected and have washed their hands &#8211; meanwhile watch the figures they release for next quarter &#8211; in the billions. It&#8217;s all about the money &#8211; create a fake pandemic? Surely this cannot be true &#8211; isn&#8217;t this just in movies, with George Clooney or Julia Roberts playing roles?</p>
<p>Meanwhile good Canadians are debilitated, are unable to function normally, are living in fear and uncertaintly, with their earning power threatened &#8211; Who will answer to us? We were doing the right thing!</p>

					<p>Cathy, Ann, and all of you, I have had a response from Global Television with respect to your complaints, and the possibility of doing a &#8220;16X9: The Big Picture&#8221; segment on how you have been left hanging by our government.  I made it clear to Mary Garofalo, their reporter, that the people who are suffering were told that taking the shot was safe, that they believed what they were told, and are not activists, but ordinary Canadians who feel abandoned by their government after following its advice.</p>
<p>I am very hopeful that given those parameters, Mary Garofalo will take on the task of examining what happened to you all.  She asked me point-blank, what proof do you have this is from the vaccine, and I pointed out to her that the multiplicity of symptoms common to many of you and the common denominator being the shot itself leads automatically to that conclusion&#8230; and she agreed that was pretty solid reasoning.</p>
<p>She is going to pitch the story to her editorial team on Friday and get back to me with their determinations.  Meanwhile I would like you all to think about whether or not you would want to share your story in this manner.  It would not do anyone any good to set this up and then have everyone stay silent, so if this turns into an opportunity to have your voices heard, please do not let it slip by.</p>
<p>I will be attempting to get word to as many as I can beyond this notice to ensure that you all know if a story is being produced, so you can get your two cents&#8217; worth in. I hope with all my heart that it leads to a good resolution for you all: you have suffered, continue to suffer, and yes, you did what you felt was right with the information you had.  The point we all need to make here is that your informed consent is required by law, and you all have stated you didn&#8217;t get that.</p>
<p>Time people started to realize that just because the government says so, doesn&#8217;t make it true, and that we owe it to ourselves to research things before doing anything that can have such horrible effects.</p>
<p>Blessings and good health to all,<br />
Dee Nicholson</p>

					<p>Hi Dee, </p>
<p>I would share my story in a second. My case is not as severe as a lot of these but I have had hives on my legs, neck and back since November. They go away but come back on a daily basis. I had never had any kind of hives in my 39 years of existence. I went to a Naturopath and was able to rid myself of these for a while by drastically changing my diet. Once I tried to return to a normal life and diet, the hives returned. I know for a fact this was all caused by the vaccine. </p>

Are there any health care professionals on this site?  Do you know of any who are seeing patients in GTA/Toronto with health problems due to this injection?  </p>
<p>I had a bad bout of a respiratory flu from Sept. 24th for a good 4 weeks, coughing stuff up every day, ending the final week feeling like drowning in my fluids and got ready to go to the hospital when it finally started to be easier to breathe.  They said at first they did not know if I had the H1N1 or not, then believed I probably did not because of one factor, I did not get a high fever or fever with this flu.  I&#8217;ve been hospitalized with influenza before due to having asthma, and have had pneumonia and bronchitis repeatedly when younger adult.  This was different.  Everytime I went out into the outside air to go to the doctor, it would tighten up, and they would not hear the loose cough!  </p>
<p>After 4 weeks to a month I was exhausted, going through a personal move, and exploded (something I do not do), felt like bursting.  Maybe I thought I was better and was not.</p>
<p>2 weeks after getting rid of this flu, I was advised to get my first ever flu shot the H1N1 because of my history with health problems, weak immune system from them, picking up viruses very easily and being ill from them for many years as a history, as well as the respirator/asthma high risk category.  Approx mid November 2009 Friday 5 or 6pm, I went to get the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Symptoms:  Immediately cold, they kept me longer because I react to medications.  Within about 5 hours I began with a head that felt like someone cracked my skull with a sledge hammer on top (not like a headache at all), and I was still cold and getting colder.  By Saturday next day, I was achy, feverish, head pain, freezing cold, and watched my fever climb with 1/2 hour to about 101F.  I started sweating alot.  For a whole week, I felt like I had ice in my veins, it was more than &#8216;being cold&#8217;, and heart palpitations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s end of April now, I have had the sweats ever since.  I still shiver cold as well, still have the heart palpitations, but most of all, I can&#8217;t think straight, do not feel well, am exhausted easily, and not functioning.  In December all of sudden I went from low blood pressure readings to high.</p>
<p>Was it the flu that gave me the residual symptoms of a virus?  I am virus prone, did I have the H1N1 flu and then the shot when I shouldn&#8217;t have?  Can the adjuvent mess up a messed up immune system?  I am sensitive, health, drug wise.  Who can we see medically?  When you are sick to begin with, you know your body very well, one of these 2 events, if not both have really affected me.</p>
<p>Looking forward to any input, comments, thoughts or referrals to other sites, medical professionals.  Thank you.</p>

<p>The thought of one more person or teenager or child going through what I have been through leaves me with no other choice but to speak out so Canadians can make informed vaccine choices for themselves and their families, based on facts and concise medical knowledge.</p>
<p>I am a law abiding, tax paying upstanding citizen who has worked very hard her whole life (like many pothers who have been affilicted) &#8211; I will continue to be one after all this is said and done despite the health uncertainty I am now facing. If I can help one person be more aware and informed &#8211; I will be satisfied.</p>
<p>All  they need to do is read this forum.</p>

					<p>My husband posted my story back in January. Following the shot I was eventually completely debilitated and hospitalized due to a neurological condition called &#8220;Transverse Mylelitis&#8221;. TM is very similar to Guillan-Barre Syndrome with a couple of variations.</p>
<p>I was 27 at the time of the vaccination and in good health, and my life changed forever after bying into the media-hype. Am am grateful for my recovery so far, butI don&#8217;t want to be silent. I want people to fully understand the risks involved with the vaccine.</p>
<p>I would be first in line to tell my story to W5/16:9&#8230;. Please keep us posted.</p>
<p>I am currently following up with a Lawyer who specialized in Medical Malpractice in Toronto. I&#8217;ll let you all know if anything comes ofit. I would love for others to join me in litigation. Knowing what I know now about the risks involved, I would not have chosen to get the shot.</p>
<p>I wish everyone who is victim to the side effects of this insufficiently tested vaccine a speedy recovery and good health.</p>

					<p>I feel the same, there was fear when I went to take the shot with my kids, but I thought if the government is promoting it then I am sure they have done there due diligence and if it is like any other normal flu shot it should be okay. I thought odds are 1 in a million to get GBS. The PHAC website says side effects 1 in 10,000. Did the swine flu kill 1 in 10,000?I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p> Is it fair for the government  to promote something that could maim so many??<br />
And as of April 2010 they have approved Glaxo to see the vaccine.<br />
How many more will suffer??</p>

					<p>Dee,</p>
<p>I too would be very willing to share my story.  I have been diagnosed with Guillian Barre Syndrome, mine is a mild sub set of the disease as I never experienced paralysis.  I have a neurologist, an internal medical specialist and my family doctor who all agree this is a reaction from the H1N1 flu vaccine.  I am in Nelson, BC.  and I know of one other person on a personal level who has the same symptoms as I, we are both female, approx. the same age, I am 40.  She personally knows of several others in this town who are affected as well.  Everyone started having symptoms within a week of the shot, not otherwise sick at all.  So there is a strong case here in one town with a population of 10,000.  This is an alternative town, so many did not get the vaccine, so this is huge considering that alone.<br />
I have had to quit soccer, and cannot commit to anything as symtoms may strike out of the blue and leave me dehabilitated.  My family has suffered due to my memory failing at times, lack of concentration (brainfog) so much that dinner does not happen.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on alternative products, and accupunture etc, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>And then I have a good day and have to go like hell to catch up on all the things that have fallen behind.</p>
<p>I am happy to have found some relief to know that we can maybe do something to prevent anyone else from having this experience.</p>

<p>If your lawyer thinks there is a case and he is willing to take on the gov and pharma &#8211; let me know. There are so many of us who have had ongoing adverse effects &#8211; I will get behind any class action.<br />
-Big Pharma should BY LAW have to provide all ingredients just like any other manufacturer<br />
-Gov should not absolve Big Pharma of responsibility for their product<br />
-We trustingly put THEIR PRODUCT in our bodies because we believed it was safe.<br />
-If we can push for new legislation for Transparency for Big Pharma &#8211; we would be helping all Canadians make informed choices for their families.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the folks at this forum &#8211; you are providing a much needed platform for regular people to voice their experiences. Much appreciated.</p>

					<p>I have posted to this site several times with my H1N1 shot received Oct. 26/09.  My arm pain continues.  I am willing to step forward with the story to W5 and also any legal class action suit.  My suffering has been agonizing for over six months and my life has not been the same since that dreadful day.  </p>
<p>I have just started receiving acupuncture.  The medical profession has not doing anything to resolve my condition and so I had to try something in an alternative field.  The person I am seeing has treated several victims with my same symptoms and has had positive results so I am being very optimistic for the same for me.</p>
<p>We must stand together against the seriousness of the vagrant injuries we have sustained.  The government boldly bombarded us with advertisements in the newspapers and on television trying to scare us into getting the vaccine &#8211; now where are they?  They are certainly not stepping forward owning up to their responsibility.</p>

					<p>Immunologist, Dr. Pamela Asa was the first person to recognize that the autoimmune diseases she was seeing in military personnel mirrored those in experimental animals injected with oil formulated adjuvants. When she met a patient with similar autoimmune symptoms who had participated in an experimental herpes vaccine trial, who also knew he had been injected with MF59, a squalene adjuvant being used as a ‘placebo’ in that study, everything began to fall into place. Pam Asa contacted Dr. Robert Garry, a leading virologist at Tulane University Medical School, whose specialty is developing antibody tests and asked him to develop a test for the detection of anti-squalene antibodies – a test that ultimately became the most important forensic and diagnostic tool identifying patients whose autoimmune diseases followed injection with squalene laced anthrax vaccine.

<p>We want answers..why did the Canadian Govt approve the Squalene containing vaccine.<br />
It could take upto to 3 yrs to be severely ill according to one Gulf war Syndrome victim,</p>

I was wondering what the connection was between the Gulf war people that were vaccinated and the people like myself who had H1N1 shots and who have unfortunately experienced side effects. Are you saying we were also injected with a similar squalene vaccine or is it that we have been used as &#8220;guinea pigs&#8221; ourselves just like the soldiers. Not sure that I understand what you are trying to say in your post. I feel badly for all the soldiers affected by those shots and feel we have all been given a raw deal. Thanks.</p>

					<p>Martin, I am very afraid of the symptoms I am having, my blood work is normal but am I constantly getting pain in my body, be it back , head, joints, eye, knees, there is something going on. In my research I came across Gulf War Syndrome and that could have been caused by SQUALENE because the sick soldiers had high anti-bodies to squalene. Our vaccine has the adjuvant Squalene which has been considered too dangerous to be used in vaccines by United States but Canada went ahead and I ask why. Squalene causes all kinds of side effects when injected in rats.<br />
I don;t know if my symptoms will go away or will get worse. I have an appointment with a rheaumatolgist in July. Today a friend in Winnipeg who too the h1n1 shot had a cyst removed form her foot and a friend in montreal said his leg have bee stiff too. Are  are symptoms going to get worse??? I am worrying every day.</p>

					<p>Wanda and Martin, although we are not supposed to be posting anything other than reports here, I am leaving the post in on GWS and squalene, because of its importance.</p>
<p>What you all must realize is that the most success in treating the symptoms people have listed here is in naturopathic/orthomolecular treatments. </p>
<p>For further info on what has worked, please refer to <a href="http://www.drbuttar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drbuttar.com</a> and do continue to dig.  </p>
<p>For your edification I have had replies from both Global and CTV&#8217;s W5 about this page and the people here who need help.  Because it is the season&#8217;s end for series, 16X9 is considering the story for September, as they have completed filming.  W5 acknowledged my submission, but has not officially replied to it.<br />
Still working on it.  I will make efforts to publicize this in next month&#8217;s Agora Magazine, and will share the story broadly.  You can help by sharing it as well, when it&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, although I don&#8217;t want to sound crass, this group, which is making so many efforts to make this issue public, would sure be delighted if you good folks could support the work.  Donation instructions are on the main page&#8230; scroll down just a bit.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.  We promise we will do everything we can to help you&#8230; but we need your help to do that.</p>

I have written two posts on this site, one in November(dated March 31) and another some time in April. I am worried sick about my family, as I am sure that four out of six of us all have had, and are still having side effects from this vaccine.  I  have gotten an autoimmune disorder and other unexplained pains and weaknesses since I&#8217;ve had the shot.  My two young children still complain about prickle bushes in their feet and legs.  That is my four year olds most recent description of what she feels.   My husband suffers pains in his hand, feet and leg.  It was my idea to get this vaccine and  I am tortured with the guilt as well as feared for what is happening to them.  Please read my other posts as I would share my family&#8217;s story anytime.</p>

					<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In keeping with the intention of this site I would like to post a follow up to my previously posted symtoms. Basically there has been no change in my condition, I am still experiencing hives/pressure hives and continue the antihistamine regime. I am now 6 month’s post vaccine.</p>
<p>I find the information on “SQUALENE” very interesting, and would surely lend my experiences to any established medium that would like to communicate our suffering and validate our stories. </p>
<p>Thank God for this site, let’s keep this momentum going.</p>

					<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just for the record, my 20 month old daughter, has started exhibiting symptoms again after 4 months of nothing.  She had numbness/tingling and tripping over her leg for two months right after the shot, and then I thought she had cleared because it went away.  Two nights ago she had a fever and then the next day started grabbing her arm/hand/knee/calf on her right side, in pain.  The same side she was affected on as before.  Now today she has a very sore neck, and tingling on her forhead/face.  She can talk sentences, she tells me where it hurts.  And points, and says tickle?  like she is puzzled, and because I have those same symptoms all of the time I know exactly what she means.  So I guess because she is sick she is symptomatic again.  I did take her to ER to rule out ear infection and meningitis, which she does not have.  Anyone else with kids who are reacting like this?<br />
I really don&#8217;t want anyone else to have to go through this, we have try and get this out so others do not have to deal with this.  My daughter does not have any underlying issues, nor did I, this is just from the vaccine!</p>

					<p>Hi Carmen, </p>
<p>Yes, both my younger children have experienced symptoms after getting the shot.  My Two year old son would grab his arm, leg and foot in distress and say owy owy mommy, my had hurts and when I would ask him where specific he would pinch at his hand and cry and say that it was inside his hand.  This happened in various  parts of his body.  He complained about his legs hurting within hours of getting the shot.  My three year old daughter had similar sypmtoms but she could explain them to me better. From the day she got the shot she has complained of sore leg, feet, hands, stomach, eyes and head. She has described the feeling in her hands and feet as sometimes feeling crunchy (I think this was the tingling)  She has cries out in pain out of the blue that her feet hurt or it might be her hand or finger,  She still complains of all these things except the crunchy part.  I have taken her to the doctor and had blood work done on her to be tested for autoimmune (it&#8217;s an ANA test) it was negative, yet she still continues to complain of various pains throughout her body.  I pray and pray this will go away and we will all be o.k.  I posted some of my story somewhere in the November column under Brenda F as my symptoms were horrific, I acually thought I was dying, I have gotten an autoimmune from this shot, my blood work suggests Lupus although I am still seeing specialists.  My husband has suffered along with us as well.  From the very beginning he&#8217;s had the tingling, tightness in his muscles and severe weakness in his entire body especially his hands and arms and feet and legs.  Today he can barely sqeeze his hands together they hurt so much and some days he has a limp when he walks because his foot is so sore.  He also has had blood work done and x rays with no answers.  We are from Langley BC and I am also wondering if anyone has recovered completely from this vaccine.  Four out of six  of my family members have been affected from this horrible vaccine that the government said  would have no serious side effects, even my doctor told me I had nothing to worry about, that I should be more concerned about getting the H1N1 flu it&#8217;s self.  If any one can help me with advice I sure could use the support right now .  Please read my last post, It is in November somewhere under Brenda F.</p>

					<p>I am a 52 year old female.  I decided to do research on the internet  this morning to see if other people have been having similar symptoms as me.  I had the H1N1 shot mid November.  I started to have severe headaches mid December.  I can&#8217;t recall if I had a milder headache just after the shot but the headaches became cronic in December along with tingling on the left side of my face.  I went to our Chiropractor a couple of times for treatments as I have had stress headaches in the past.  These headaches are very different though.  It starts in the left side of my neck right up to the back of my ear(same side as my shot) and the base of my neck and moves up my head.  I would take Advill and a heating pad and lie down eventually falling to sleep.  My Chriopractor advised that I have message therapy.  I went to my doctor who advised that I take physio and message therapy.  I started therapy mid February  up until yesterday.  My headaches are pretty well gone except the left side of my neck still feels stiff all the time but thankfully less pain.    I have this fear that my neck will always be stiff.  I do the excersies that the therapists gave me every day and will continue to.   Secondly, my husband&#8217;s left arm aches (the arm he had the H1N1 shot in) when he tryes to lift it or if it sits for a while.  He said he feels like the ache is deep in the bone.    Thank you for this opportunity to share our concerns.</p>

					<p>I received the H1N1 vaccination on October 30, 2009.  By the next day I got a severe migraine headache.  I could not get rid of the migraine and after 5 or 6 days of this I went to Emergency because I couldn&#8217;t tolerate the pain any longer.  The gave me something to take away the pain and I was sent home.  I ended up getting the migraine back right away and it lasted for over 6 weeks.  I was also feeling &#8220;out of it&#8221; at work.  I couldn&#8217;t think straight or concentrate on what I was doing.  I also had extreme fatigue.  I went to my family doctor and they kept trying different medications for migraines, however, nothing worked.  I had to go off work for about 3 weeks at that time.   I finally ended up getting a head CT Scan and everything was normal.  It is now May and I am still not feeling well.  I am normally a very energetic, active person and I have found that I have no energy and the fatigue is something I cannot get over.  I feel almost like I am getting a flu or something all the time.  My doctors are &#8220;shrugging&#8221; me off and I am just so tired of this!  I have been told by doctors that all of this is from stress.  My job is highly stressful, however, I am not totally convinced that this is what it is because I have taken a leave of absence for the last few months and I am still not feeling great.</p>
<p>Is it just coincidence that all this started after the H1N1 vaccination or not?</p>

					<p>Hello everyone,<br />
Here&#8217;s an interesting article regarding mercury poisoning.  </p>
<p><a href="http://naturalcandidacleansing.com/Mercury_Poisoning_Symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://naturalcandidacleansing.com/Mercury_Poisoning_Symptoms.html</a></p>
<p>The article relates to candida however it lists the symptoms of mercury poisoning.  The following excerpt relates to a lot of the posters here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercury poisoning symptoms will also come and go and are usually not constant. It affects everyone differently depending on his or her personal physiology. Overall, a person may have long periods of great productivity in their lives followed by periods of being nonproductive. As the poisoning progresses, these periods of productivity become shorter and fewer in-between. Poisoning sets in slowly and progresses thru levels of increasing dysfunction. &#8220;</p>

					<p>Extreme weakness and tired at times as well as dizziness; all coming on in waves throughout the day. Has been going on for weeks, and weeks. Feel better one day and like I am really sick the next day. Or, I feel fine when I wake up and sick within 20 minutes. Got an extremely bad sinus infection which will not go away despite using antibiotics and trying many natural remedies The brain fog is unbelievable. I don&#8217;t trust myself to drive or do anything else that require fast reflex action. I keep missing work because I am just feeling too wrung out to do anything. My family have had repeated bouts of sore throat and cold; severe vomilting and diahhea. Another thing seems to be getting unusually cold feet at night. One gets better for a few days and then it is right back again. We are all at the end of our rope trying to deal with this. The only thing we all have in common is the H1N1 and regular flu shots which we had around October or November. We felt we had to get the shots because we have several very young children in the family and were told by the government that we could not safely be around them unless we got immunized. I really regret it now.</p>

					<p>Hi there,<br />
I relate to your symptoms; mine are the same except for the vomiting and diarrhea.  Didn&#8217;t feel safe to drive either.  I posted previously with all I am going thru.<br />
I would like to suggest to everyone here; try taking an antihistamine and see if your symptoms improve.  I am noticing that my symptoms improve  when I&#8217;m taking an antihistamine on a regular basis and when I forget to take it the symptoms return.  Could be the mercury in the flu shot or an allergic reaction to another ingredient it it.<br />
For the last few years I have had the seasonal flu shot and am only now suspecting it to be the culprit of my symptoms.  In November 09 I had the h1n1 a week apart from the seasonal flu shot and feel like the symptoms are the same but intensified.<br />
In the past, my symptoms eventually disappeared.  I hope that is the case with everyone here.<br />
I will never ever, ever get any flu shot ever, ever again.</p>

					<p>Hi Anna , it occured to me yesterday that we are getting an allergic reaction.<br />
I will start giving my son antihistamine and take some myself.<br />
He has constantly had a running nose since dec then had pneumonia in may and I think he is allergic to something in the shot.<br />
Could knee pain and swelling, body pain, tiredness  be an allergic reaction too?<br />
How are you feeling now?</p>

					<p>Hi Wanda,<br />
I was thinking that myself that it&#8217;s possible that it&#8217;s an allergic reaction.  I also had quite the runny nose from March to May and I don&#8217;t have seasonal allergies.   I&#8217;m not sure about the knee pain but maybe swelling, body pain and tiredness could be related in your case.  I&#8217;m seeing an allergy specialist in August and will ask to be tested for the flu shot ingredients.</p>
<p>I started getting sick off and on 3 years ago with similar symptoms.  And 3 years ago I also started getting the seasonal flu shots.  So I&#8217;m now thinking there has to be a connection.  In Nov/09 I got both the seasonal &amp; h1n1 shots and it seems I really paid the price with getting both of them.  I got them 1 week apart and in the same arm. </p>
<p>The following is from:</p>
<p>&#8220;PRODUCT INFORMATION LEAFLET </p>
<p>AREPANRIX™ H1N1 </p>
<p>Interactions<br />
No data are available on the concomitant administration of Arepanrix™ H1N1 with other<br />
vaccines, including seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines.  Such data are in development,<br />
and this document will be amended to include them as soon as available. However, if co-<br />
administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunization should be carried out on<br />
separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. &#8221;</p>
<p>I have been feeling much much better and only in the last couple of days.  My symptoms have severely lessened and are almost all gone.  Still slight burning feeling on the top of my head every couple of days.  But that sicky, yucky feeling is no longer there.</p>
<p>I thought I read somewhere that the health organization didn&#8217;t know if one flu shot would be enough and that two (2) shots might be needed to protect from the h1n1 flu.  My symptoms have been with me for 7 months so maybe it&#8217;s almost out of my system.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking Wanda and I hope you feel better soon too.</p>

					<p>To Brenda F.  and others if interested.  There is an amazing support group for those experiencing tingling and muscle, brain fog type symptoms.  There are people from all parts of the world on there having the exact same issues.  We do support one another and give helpful advice as well.<br />
medhelp.org is the site, and then go to immunizations and vaccine, then you will see the tinglers chapter 2, click on that and read on some of the posts they helpful.<br />
My three 3 year old son complains of sore feet at times, and I notice when he first gets up he walks funny for a bit.  He also tip toes, so I don&#8217;t know if that is related either.  I am so sorry to hear you two kids and family are having to deal with this.  It is hard and can be quite depressing at times.  It has been 6 months for a lot of people and it is getting exhausting.  I do think some people have improved a lot and are better.  But these symptoms do come and go, good day or days and then BAM bad day or bad hour&#8230;no rhyme or reason.  Just when you think you are maybe through with all this, it strikes, throws you off of your game and I find that the most depressing.</p>
<p>Sorry I know this is not a forum, just a reporting site.  I think it is important to note that depression has now become part of the symptom list, as it is impossible to have a normal life right now.</p>

					<p>I just discovered this website a couple of days ago when my husband suggested that I look into a Class Action suit for H1N1 vaccine side effects.  I received the H1N1 vaccine on Oct. 29 2009 as ordered by my supervisor as I work in a Medical Clinic at a Hospital and was told if I didn&#8217;t and got the flu, I would not be paid for sick time.  Immediately upon receiving the injection, my left arm felt sore, then that evening swelling and hot at the injection site.  For a week I suffered from severe flu symptoms like never before.  The severe flu symptoms subsided after 2 weeks, but I never felt like myself, and my arm continued to be very sore and swollen.  My Doctors told me it would get better and no big deal.  So I then got my 12 year old daughter vaccinated.</p>
<p>Well, my symptoms did not get better, my lymph nodes were so plugged that I had to get lymphnode drainage done every 3 weeks because by body was so puffy, and especially in my left arm &amp; neck  and down the left side of my body.  Constant body aches and tingling and numbness in my left arm, and then the shooting nerve pain that i would experience out of the blue!  Difficulty in dressing, unable to use my left arm for anything, and  pain would keep me awake at night.  Ibuprophen didn&#8217;t help.  By the middle of December my sypmtoms were getting worse, so I insisted on referral to physiotherapy and a referral to Rheumatologist. Ultrasound of shoulder and blood work was done but showed nothing.  By mid January, I saw the Rheumatologist who diagnosed me with a frozen left shoulder, which she surmised was because I &#8220;babied&#8221; my arm since receiving my vaccine.  She injected cortisone into the shoulder which helped for a couple of weeks, but by mid February my symptoms were worse.  During this time physiotherapy wasn&#8217;t helping at all.  There was too much nerve pain to do any of the exercises.  So I asked my Doctor for a referral for nerve conduction studies which will be done next month.  At the beginning of March my physiotherapist referred me to another Physio Clinic (because he couldn&#8217;t do anything for me) for ultrasound, accupuncture and physio which I have been doing weekly since then.  The nerve pain was too great for much improvement, so I sought out a friend who does Rieki and Cranio-sacral therapy and she has helped me out a lot.  She says that she could not believe how badly my nerves were enflamed (now 5 months post injection).  So for the last couple of months, I have been getting acupuncture, ultrasound and nerve therapy on a weekly basis and I seem to be making slow progress which is better than a couple of months ago when I just seemed to get worse with each passing week.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s now been almost 7 months since my vaccine,  and I still feel like crap, no energy, sleepless nights, stiff neck and shoulder, sore left knee and sore left foot (feels like I&#8217;m walking on a nail some days) and a brain fog which seems to come and go.</p>
<p>One more thing,  a couple of weeks ago my 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroiditis.  No family history and no signs or symptoms&#8230;our Pediatrician was just doing some lab work looking for something else when it was discovered&#8230;this is an autoimmune disorder normally found in women over 30 years of age&#8230;with family history.  I&#8217;m now wondering if this is something other parents should be checking into if their daughter has had this vaccine, remember that my daughter was showing no signs of thyroid disorder before.</p>
<p>I would definitely be interested in a class action lawsuit.  I am so angry that we were not made aware of what this vaccine contained.</p>

					<p>Hi Lee,<br />
Thank you for the information regarding possible litigation on this matter.  I&#8217;m wondering though, how is it possible to prove that the h1n1 vaccine is the cause of all of our symptoms.<br />
Also, to everyone; it really ticks me off that all the information regarding the vaccine side effects have only reported the side effects immediately after the injection and not months later.   From what I have read,  the effects of the ingredients of the shot surface much later.</p>

					<p>I had the H1N1 vaccine in early November, 2009.  Six days later I developed a sore and tingly scalp, tingling in my hands and feet, sensitive teeth and facial pain.  A few months later I developed dizziness, brain fog, and very dry skin and a dry mouth.  I have seen my doctor numerous times this year.  Today I was finally told that it looks like I have an autoimmune disease called Sjogren&#8217;s Syndrome.  My doctor also told me that the vaccine did not cause this.  But he also said that because I have genetic markers for autoimmune problems, the vaccine may have triggered this disease.  I may or may not have developed Sjogren&#8217;s during my life, but the vaccine certainly helped.  I wish I had never received it.  My sister in Florida is also experiencing identical symptoms to mine which also started 6 days after she received her H1N1 vaccine last November.</p>

					<p>I first posted March 19th, 2010.  I am still, like many of you,  been unwell since the first week of January.  My continuing question regards the H1N1 vaccine which the government thrust upon us in the panic of a  pandemic.  Since I live in a small community of 3500 people (Blind River, Ontario)  I enrolled to help out in the hospital as a volunteer if there was a pandemic.  I got the vaccination to ensure I would be well enough to help.  That panic was over emphasized by the Governemtn and I regret to this day I allowed them to give me the H1N1 vaccine.  I am thankful my adult children did not heed the go9vernment warnings and vaccinate themselves and their children.  </p>
<p>I am still not well enough to drive, and most days I am productive for only about 10% of the day.  Every day is a struggle and no matter what I try I cannot regain my former self.  This week I made an appointment with the Bay College Lockwood Clinic in Toronto to try to find answers.  Unfortunately I could not get an appointment until September 14th!   I am 66 years old and feel somewhat encouraged to read of the &#8216;brain fog&#8217; experienced by so many and realize it is not only age related.   It is so frustrating and makes you feel so helpless.   I feel as though I am existing not living.</p>
<p>Lets keep supporting one another and if anyone feels better let&#8217;s post it&#8230;even if it is temporarily.  I felt better for about a week in April but then the decline began and I am back to the way I felt in February.  I keep hoping the summer sun will burn it out of our systems!!</p>

					<p>HI everyone,</p>
<p>My little boy Logan has never been the same since his H1N1 vaccines he received in late Nov &amp; early Dec. I don&#8217;t even know where to start as it has been a long painful road for me &amp; my family. Logan hasn&#8217;t felt well in several months now &amp; continues to get worse. He complained about not really feeling well shortly after his first injection, then he seemed a bit better. It was after his second shot that things really took a turn for the worst&#8230;.he started to be less &amp; less intereseted in eating, to the point where he lost a significant amount of weight &amp; his eyes and cheeks were sunk in. He screamed in pain from the stomach aches and cried daily from the throbbing headaches he had. He started having severe sleep disturbances and his behaviour became more and more concerning. It didnt take long before I didnt recognise my own son anymore. We tried to get to the bottom of Logans health concerns and at first didnt even think it could be the vaccine doing this to him. He developed sever food sensitivities and could no longer properly digest protiens. we had to change his diet to wheat &amp; dairy free &amp; if he does get anything that is hard to digest he violently throws up. He woke up many mornings in a pool of his own vomit &amp; urine. He also complains daily of muscle aches &amp; tells me that his bones hurt. Lab tests have shown that Logan has none of the good bacteria found in his digestive tract &amp; that he has an immunoglobulin A deficiency. He also now has a low red blood cell count &amp; is slightly anemic.He also has a high level of reactive lymphocytes in his blood, my research has taught me that this is usually associated with a viral illness but can also be present as a result of immunizations. Logans hemoglobin is also low. He is pale &amp; has splotches all over his face. He tires easily and generally is moody &amp; upset. I think he is pretty much in constant pain now for months. We are all worried sick about him. We have reported these adverse effects to Logans pediatrician &amp; to his family Dr. I sent a fax to his pediatrician regarding this matter to which he never responded &amp; the last time we were in Edmonton to see him he wouldnt discuss this matter with us. We also told our family Dr. here in Cold Lake what was happening and we were suspecting the H1N1 vaccine has something to do with our sons deteriorating health. He refused to talk about it either &amp; actually pretended he didnt hear me and started talking about something else. The real kick in the teeth came today when I took Logan up to see our Dr again to see if anymore lab resutls came back &amp; to discuss Logans anxiety issues &amp; see if there was anything he could do or suggest to help. He handed me a few paper stapled together and told me to ask his receptionist to copy them for me&#8230;he then told me that he feels there is nothing more he can do to help Logan and advised us that we needed to find A NEW FAMILY DR!!!!!!!  Now thats all fine &amp; dandy but the sad part is that we live in a small community where we are facing a SEVERE doctor shortage &amp; there are NO doctors accepting new patients. I was totally SHOCKED!!!!!! I spent the remainder of the day in tears wondering how on earth we are  going to find another dr. So now we have a little boy who has been diagnosed on the autism spectrum, who is chronically ill &amp; we have NO family doctor. We are devastated &amp; have no idea where we are going to turn or if we are ever going to find a doctor who cares. Logan has always had a weak immune system &amp; getting the H1N1 vaccine is probably the worst mistake I ever made &amp; my little boy has suffered ever since. To top it all off our family doctor has now turned us away and won&#8217;t see him anymore&#8230;we need help desperately &amp; have no idea whats going to happen to our little boy.</p>

					<p>Thank you for your comment Deborah. I have contacted the local newspaper this morning &amp; also a medical officer for our area in regards to this matter. I am not sure what will come of any of it but I know I will at least try for the sake of my son &amp; every one else who suffered from this horrible vaccine. I will keep you all posted on what happens from here on in. We all need to support eachother and stand together to be heard.<br />
Take care</p>

					<p>I am in tears for you, over Logan&#8217;s story.  I would go to the media over this.  That is unacceptable.  You are not alone, there are others with children who are experiencing the effects of the vaccine.   There is a forum that has a lot of support for reactions to this.   (medhelp.org)  (go to immunization section and you will see something about the tinglers chapter 2, there are regular posters on there with love and support).  I am so very sorry that you are experiencing this as a mom.  Do remind yourself why you made the decision to have him vaccinated, it was out of love and fear of losing him to the H1N1 Flu.  I know that you must be in agony over that decision, we all have been and still are.  I just find it helps if we go back and think of why we did this.<br />
caring,<br />

					<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a 59 year old male living in Edmonton, Alberta. For the past forty years I was extremely healthy and active playing hockey and working in an office/construction type job. In November 2009, I received my first ever flu shot and H1N1 flu shot. About 1 week later I tried to get up from my office desk and my leg muscles wouldn’t work. It was like someone flipped a switch and they were turned off. With some effort I was able to stand and walk around but the muscles just above the knee were working at about 5% capacity. Over Christmas, the muscle weakness/paralysis moved upwards into my arms and it became extremely difficult to lift anything heavier than a cup of coffee. </p>
<p>At this same time I went to see my GP about the problem and he sent me for a battery of blood tests, x-rays, etc. and he then referred me to a neurologist. At the end of January 2010, the neurologist examined me for about 15 minutes in his office and told me he’s 99% certain that I have Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). The next day I had an electromyography (EMG) and a second neurologist positively diagnosed GBS. </p>
<p>I had a medical for my life insurance in October 2009 and was 100% healthy at that time. The only thing different in my life was getting the swine flu and regular flu shot about 1 week before the muscle weakness occurred. </p>
<p>Over the past 6 months, the weakness has progressed to the point that I am off work and bed-ridden 23 hours a day. I have had 3 IVIG treatments each lasting 5 days and my neurologist has me on a cocktail of immunosuppressant and steroid drugs (Immuron, Pantoprazole and Prednisone). He believes that I may be able to go back to work in 1-2 years, but everyone responds differently to treatment and it is difficult to make an accurate prognosis. </p>
<p>Financially, it is a disaster because I expected to work another 6 or 7 years at which time our mortgage would be paid off and we would be on OAS. Both our daughters are in University and we have everyday household expenses to deal with. We have already gone through quite a bit of our savings but it is hard to know when I will be able to get back to work. Fortunately, my wife is at home and cooks my meals and is a main caregiver. Otherwise, I would probably have to be hospitalized for several months. </p>
<p>It is very frustrating that the Government of Canada promotes and endorses the idea that every Canadian should get a swine flu shot, even people in my age group who are considered low-risk for swine flu, but high-risk for contracting illnesses like GBS-CIDP. It is also frustrating that there is no safety net or financial support to deal with patients who experience serious adverse effects like myself. </p>
<p>Thank you for your website and for giving me the opportunity to express my views.</p>
<p>Charlie in Edmonton</p>

					<p>I have asked our pediatrician to have Logan tested for GBS and vasculitis&#8230;does anyone have any more ideas?? We have been complaining and reporting things but so far all the blood tests are coming up within the normal range except for his immunoglobulin A which is very very low&#8230;.it has been that way for a month now that we know of. Logan has always had a weak immune system but before he had the H1N1 vaccine he had NO digestive issues, he didn&#8217;t scream in pain from headaches, he didnt feel sick all the time &amp; throw up sparatically especially in the mornings, he didn&#8217;t wake up in the middle of the night screaming, he didnt wake up in a pile of his own vomit, he didn&#8217;t violently attack his teachers&#8230;please we are desperate for help. Does anyone have any other thoughts on what is going on &amp; what we can do??? The doctors dont feel he is acutely sick and will not admit him. I witnessed him come running into my room at 630am crying and screaming that he didnt feel good then throw up all over my bed. he also has had night sweats for months where he soaks his bed in sweat. whats going on?? please help anyone who might know whats going on??</p>

					<p>I will try to get internet media time available for you folks if you are willing to speak publicly.  You can do this as well.  Unfortunately I wouldn&#8217;t hold out too much hope for mainstream media, though we do have Mary Garofalo interested in doing a story on Global&#8217;s 16X9: The Big Picture.  She wanted to present it to her team but had finished her season. I&#8217;m forwarding some of your reports to her so that she can see what you are all going through.  She&#8217;s a decent lady&#8230; a family woman.  </p>
<p>However, I want to pose another issue to you, which may seem far afield, but it is not.</p>
<p>This is Bill C-36, the Canada Consumer Products Protection Act,  which is the reincarnation of Bill C-6, the one you&#8217;ve seen on this site all along.  it is a government bill, introduced by the Health Minister on Wednesday.</p>
<p>You need to realize that the reason why these vaccines were shoved so rudely upon us, without proper information and without proper testing, was our obligations to the WHO.  Nations signatory to the UN are legally bound to follow their orders in case of a pandemic, and while they did not force any nation, they certainly have the power to do so.  And oh, yes, it&#8217;s relevant.</p>
<p>There is currently an investigation ongoing to determine whether or not there was a conspiracy to use a fake pandemic to generate billions in profit for pharmaceutical vaccine makers.  But while this is happening before our eyes, has the WHO withdrawn the pandemic alert?  NO! The very vaccines which probably caused all your misery are now being foisted on third world nations as a &#8220;gift&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some gift.</p>
<p>In Bill C-36, as in the original Bill C-6, there is a clause making Canadians subject to the dictates of foreign authorities, including trade groups.  Just as the WHO could order the suspension of national governments, mandate full population vaccination against our will,  and institute martial law if it wanted, so these trade groups can force us to accept health standards that we don&#8217;t want, and can overrule our own sovereign laws.  </p>
<p>We don&#8217;t feel this is the way Canadians want to live.  IMHO, I think Canadians want to BE Canadians, and have representation in government which can make laws that benefit them, not some pharmaceutical corporation or other international profit machine.  For this, and other reasons, we are adamantly raising the flag again, to say NO to Bill C-36.  </p>
<p>The link between your probable vaccine damage and this bill is this:  Health Canada is putting forward Bill C-36 with the idea that they stand for the health and well-being of Canadians.  How can this be, when they allowed, at the same time as they were pushing this Bill last year, the heavily promoted and recommended, but LARGELY UNTESTED Arepanrix vaccine, the very shot which may have done all the damage reported here?  Is this the action of a Ministry which truly cares?  How about the fact that none of you have had the slightest indication from government at ANY level that they actually give a tinker&#8217;s dam about how you suffer?  This is the same ministry which wants to have all the powers of a police force, and has used those powers against many&#8230; including by raiding, SWAT-style, guns drawn, the home of an Alberta naturopath for the ungodly crime of selling Folic acid and Vitamin B12.  The man&#8217;s family was held at gunpoint for 11 hours, January 11th, 2009, they took all his products, and never gave them back, even though most of them were not subject to their jurisdiction as they were destined offshore.  There was no warrant.  And the Health Minister wants the right to do that to ANYONE she sees fit, over a mere suspicion.</p>
<p>Back to what this same Ministry has done about YOU: First, they say their mandate is consumer safety, but how safe was that vaccine? Second, they want to make us subject to the dictates of foreign authorities, like the WHO, the UN, or even a trade group: do you want your health and product safety regulations determined by offshore authorities who are completely unaccountable to you?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely,  we must get your stories out, all of them.  You must not be allowed to suffer without recourse against those who caused your suffering.  And the same Ministry that wants the powers of police and courts via Bill C-36 is the one that ignores you as if you have no right of redress, and leaves you with no option but to struggle.</p>
<p>Please, all of you&#8230; stand with us to fight this Bill. Call, write or email your MPs and tell them what you&#8217;re going through and that you don&#8217;t want Health Canada to consort with foreign authorities, and you want the Ministry, since they okayed the product that harmed you, to demonstrate to all Canadians that they indeed serve their mandate, before they should be handed overarching powers to determine our well-being.</p>
<p>The more you speak, the more you can win back for yourselves and your families.  If you suffer in silence, who will hear you?</p>
<p>Read the bill here:<br />

<p>It was the culmination of 10 years of pandemic preparedness planning<br />
for WHO—years of committee meetings with experts flown in from<br />
around the world and reams of draft documents offering guidance to<br />
governments. But one year on, governments that took advice from WHO<br />
are unwinding their vaccine contracts, and billions of dollars’<br />
worth of stockpiled oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir<br />
(Relenza)—bought from health budgets already under tight<br />
constraints—lie unused in warehouses around the world.</p>
<p>A joint investigation by the BMJ and the Bureau of Investigative<br />
Journalism has uncovered evidence that raises troubling questions<br />
about how WHO managed conflicts of interest among the scientists who<br />
advised its pandemic planning, and about the transparency of the<br />
science underlying its advice to governments. Was it appropriate for<br />
WHO to take advice from experts who had declarable financial and<br />
research ties with pharmaceutical companies producing antivirals and<br />
influenza vaccines? Why was key WHO guidance authored by an influenza<br />
expert who had received payment for other work from Roche,<br />
manufacturers of oseltamivir, and GlaxoSmithKline, manufacturers of<br />
zanamivir (AND AREPANRIX ~ DN)? And why does the composition of the emergency committee from which Chan sought guidance remain a secret known only to those<br />
within WHO? We are left wondering whether major public health<br />
organisations are able to effectively manage the conflicts of interest<br />
that are inherent in medical science.</p>

					<p>Those that received N1H1, and have had side effects &#8230; this vaccine was never tested and fresh off the burner.  The &#8216;flu&#8217; was concocted back in the mid 90s and dropped.  The big drug companies were the ones to gain, along with government support.  There is a flu season every year.  The elderly and very ill, unfortunately, don&#8217;t have the means to fight it and it does takes its toll.  There was no pandemic with N1H1 &#8211; the pandemic was built up by drug companies and government to brainwash others along the way.  My own doctor refused to even have this vaccine and did not impose it on his patients unless asked for.  I would bet your own MP/MPP did not have this vaccine!!  The &#8216;vaccine&#8217; came out before the &#8216;bug&#8217; did.  I hope all of those that did get the vaccine are able to get restitution.</p>

					<p>Hello everyone,<br />
I just came back from my doctor and I did not get support from him that my symptoms are related to the h1n1 shot.  I say &#8220;bull&#8221;, but  I was not going to argue.  He said that if I were to have side effects they would only last for 1-2 months.  Again I say &#8220;bull&#8221;.   His diagnosis was fibromyalgia and depression.  It is really pathetic that a lot of doctors today blame everything on depression.</p>
<p>My symptoms are gradually going away but are still present (it&#8217;s now 6 months post vaccine).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think  that it will ever be possible to convince any government representative that any of us here are suffering side effects from the h1n1 vaccine unless it is truly Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  If anyone has any suggestions please reply.</p>
<p>I wish everyone here good luck with a speedy recovery.</p>

					<p>Thanks Anna.<br />
I would like to know more about your case and symptoms. I had eye pain and dry lips two weeks after the shot in Dec 09.In March I had knee pain for three weeks, then I got joint pain and muscle pain and back and neck stiffness occassionally and it is June now and the pain is not severe but still comes and goes but my eye pain is becoming more constant and getting mild head pain.</p>
<p>And I seem to get new pain in the calf,arms, foot , back&#8230;..6 months and there is always something or the other. Going back to the doctor on Tuesday and a first appointment with rheumatologist on July 13th.<br />
Been to an eye doctor too and more tests coming up for glaucoma.</p>

					<p>Hi there Wanda,<br />
I initially posted on April 23rd, but I&#8217;ll summarize my symptoms here.<br />
headache<br />
fatigue<br />
sweating<br />
dizziness<br />
generally feeling unwell<br />
weakness<br />
stomach pain<br />
inability to sleep<br />
shortness of breath<br />
rash on head<br />
stiff neck<br />
blood shot eye<br />
dry mouth and lips<br />
excessive drooling when lying down<br />
metallic taste<br />
chemical sensitivity (prescriptions and smells)</p>
<p>severe stabbing along nerves in my head; when I initially experienced this symptom I described it as a hole being drilled in my head.  It was when I read the side effects in the product information leaflet I was convinced all my symptoms are h1n1 vaccine related.</p>

<p>I have never experienced anything like this in my life and it is very frustrating not being taken seriously.<br />
I honestly thought I was going to die.<br />
Thank you for your interest.</p>

					<p>Hi Anna,<br />
Thanks for sharing.<br />
I guess we are the 1 in 10000. So out of 2 million that makes 200 of us with the side effects and to the government that is expected and not a big deal.<br />
But I am surprised that doctors do not take it seriously.</p>

					<p>That figure, you must be aware, is a GUESS, not an actual prediction, especially given the lack of testing given the vaccines used.  Furthermore, there are 33 million people in this country, about a third of whom took the vaccine.  That&#8217;s 11 million people.  So really, it&#8217;s more than a THOUSAND damaged individuals, even by their own reckoning&#8230;. and since there are 321 posts here, the vast majority of them single posts, and since this site is not known to everyone, nor do all sufferers report their difficulties, we can safely assume there are a great many individuals who have been damaged.  </p>
<p>If a class action suit under the &#8220;Hazardous Products Act&#8221; were to be instituted, the government would be forced to admit that it guaranteed that it would take full responsibility for damages.  Well, where is the government now?  This is the whole point.  The government does not want to admit that their little endeavor caused all this, even though they offered to compensate for it.  People complaining to their doctors are in some cases being thrown out of the office and told to find a new doctor.  This is not right, it is not just, and it is not lawful&#8230; and our government, especially the Health Ministry, needs to step up and take its lumps along with anybody else who does harm and gets caught at it.</p>
<p>If anyone has a law firm willing to take this on as a contingency based class action suit, please do let us know.  We would like to assist in any and every way possible.  We also ask, in light of Bill C-36, which is the old Bill C-6 noted on our home page and is the replacement for the &#8220;Hazardous Products Act&#8221;, why this ministry should be given overarching police powers to protect Canadians from hazardous baby cribs and the like, when clearly it is not protecting anybody from anything unless it serves the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>I cannot find words to express my total and overwhelming disgust for that ministry and its minister,<br />
Leona Aglukkaq, who deserves all the disdain that Canadians can heap upon her head&#8230; as well as the Prime Minister who assured Canadians that they would be taken care of, and now ignores all the cries for help from all of you.</p>

					<p>Just wanted everyone to know how important it is for all of us to stand together &amp; support each other! I have contacted my MLA as well as the health minister for Canada in regards to what has been going on with my son. He still is very very ill &amp; its 6 months later. I am not having any luck getting anyone to do anything to help him. I haven&#8217;t been able to work because he is too sick to go to school &amp; we are missing out on thousands of dollars in wages &amp; my business is suffering. We can&#8217;t keep up with the bills anymore and we are running into serious troubles! The only Dr. we have in in Edmonton over 3 hrs away from where we live. we have several appts over the next month &amp; the expenses are starting to be more than we can pay. I think everyone of us need to start taking serious action over this&#8230;..anyone have any ideas how we can make our voices heard?? lets all help each other be heard! if we all contact health canada someone will have to respond!! I contacted them today as well as my MLA MP &amp; a minister for health in my region in MAY who promised to get back to me &amp; never called again! This is a HUGE injustice to all of us! Lets be sure our voices are not silenced!!</p>

					<p>Hi Wanda,<br />
I was not given anything to take for any of my symptoms.  When I went to emergency the 3 times, the doctors shook me off about my symptoms and did not take me seriously.  At the time I did not relate my symptoms to the h1n1 vaccine.  At that time I was experiencing severe burning and pressure on the top of my head and I had tiny sores or pimple like spots that did not itch but felt like burning pain and I  felt like I might pass out.  I am still experiencing these symptoms but they are not nearly as intense.  It&#8217;s really weird; this morning when  I woke up I felt great and then all of a sudden this weakness came over me and I felt gravely ill.  That lasted for about 1 1/2 hours and then pressure burning pain on top of my head which has been with me all day.  It feels like there might be some swelling going on there.  I had a cat scan on Saturday so I may know more once the results are in next week.  I convinced a doctor at a walk in clinic to send me for a cat scan.  My family doctor refused to do a cat scan.<br />
Thank you for the info on Giant Cell Arteritis though.</p>

I will be showing them this website &amp; that I not only want justice for my family but every other person whos life has been affected since this terrible &amp; HUGELY untested vaccine they pushed upon us in the intrest of our heath &amp; well being. I have been praying our voices are heard &amp; we all find the help we so desperately seek! I believe prayers are answered &amp; there is strength in numbers&#8230;..wish me luck because my next step is to write my story, make thousands of copies &amp; post it anywhere I can from here to Edmonton.

					<p>Hi everyone!<br />
CTV was here and interviewed me. They were very specific about what I could say. I did tell them about this website &amp; all the others suffering but I dont know what they will air. It will be on the edmonton CTV news at 6 tonight if anyone can catch it. I strongly suggest you all contact your MLA or MP and express your frustration with doctors &amp; report all your side effects from the shot. WE MUST BE HEARD!!! if we all stand up then they will have to listen&#8230;..</p>

					<p>H1N1 shot blamed for Calgary woman&#8217;s rare disorder<br />
Last Updated: Tuesday, February 23, 2010 | 2:28 PM ET Comments108Recommend36<br />
CBC News</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/02/23/calgary-h1n1-shot-reaction-disorder.html#ixzz0rG7OKctY" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/02/23/calgary-h1n1-shot-reaction-disorder.html#ixzz0rG7OKctY</a><br />
A Calgary woman regrets getting the H1N1 shot after her doctor told her it likely caused a rare and painful disorder.</p>
<p>Norma Goldring said she felt compelled to get an H1N1 vaccine because she is diabetic and has had a heart attack, two factors that Alberta Health noted as putting people at higher risk for serious complications from swine flu.</p>
<p>But soon after getting the shot last winter, Goldring felt ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;My body was aching and I was throwing up. Then I developed a spot on my leg,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The rash spread quickly and Goldring ended up in hospital on Christmas Day. &#8220;By the time I got to emergency, it spread pretty bad and turned to blisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her kidneys were shutting down. Doctors eventually diagnosed it as vasculitis, an inflammation that destroys blood vessels.</p>
<p>Her doctor, who asked not to be named, concluded it was probably connected to the H1N1 shot. Goldring, according to her doctor, is one of only 31 people since 1974 to have had this type of reaction to a flu shot.<br />
Won&#8217;t get shot again, says Goldring</p>
<p>Now, even using a walker to get from her living room to her kitchen causes her excruciating pain. She is on pain killers and steroids.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like I was put through a fire. It was like someone lit me on fire,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Goldring said she won&#8217;t get a flu shot again. Desmond Fordyce, her partner, said he is worried the vaccine wasn&#8217;t tested properly before widespread public vaccinations began.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re killing you more than giving you something for making you better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Glen Armstrong, head of the microbiology and infectious diseases department at the University of Calgary, said the H1N1 vaccine is safe. &#8220;It&#8217;s very clear that the benefits of having people get vaccinated, far, far outweigh the risks of the very small number of adverse reactions to the vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, 25 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed across Canada. Nearly 6,000 H1N1 shots resulted in an adverse reaction, of which more than 200 were considered serious. Health officials are investigating 13 post-shot deaths.</p>
<p>Alberta health officials told CBC News they have talked to Goldring&#8217;s doctor and will continue to investigate what happened in her case.</p>
<p>The province has seen 1,276 people hospitalized with H1N1 since April 2009 and 71 deaths have been connected to the virus.</p>

					<p>YES it did air. It was on the ctv Edmonton news last night at 6. It aired every hour after that on the CTV national news channel&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe it! They of course edited the heck outta the interview &amp; did not mention many things I wanted mentioned like our doctor telling us he wouldn&#8217;t see us anymore &amp; this website but don&#8217;t worry I will get it out somehow. The news clip can&#8217;t be found on line for some reason, I am not sure why. My hubby is working on getting the video we recorded on you tube&#8230;I will post that link as soon as I can, hopefully tonight! Take care everyone &amp; be persistent &amp; never give up! Someone will have to step up and take responsibility for whats happened to all of us &amp; our families! I will do anything I can to help make that happen! Much Love to you all!</p>

					<p>Thanks Kristie&#8230;</p>
<p>Though I am in the US, I have also had lots of side effects. In fact, I feel that I have nerve damage from this vaccine. Two hospital visits, no results. They told me I was nuts basically. This has been the only website that I could find people with my same symptoms. My problems have been skin crawling sensations, all over. My hands also turned black during the winter. I even had to shave my head because I wanted to see if my scalp had any parasites or such. (as a female this was heartbreaking). Luckily nothing there, just the itchiness that is getting better. I wish everyone recovery and look forward to watching the link when it is posted. </p>
<p>God Bless</p>

					<p>Hi everyone, here is the link to the video posted on Youtube.  This clip aired on CTV News on June 18th 2010.  I hope many more of your stories will be heard.  I would encourage you to contact the CTV News team and come forward with you life changing experiences since the H1N1 vaccine.  I did mention this website and all of you during my interview and was disappointed that it wasn&#8217;t mentioned on the news.  </p>

					<p>I hear your problem and hear others all keen to help you get legal advise.  I suggest that you find a Classically trained Homeopath in Edmonton as soon as possible and I am sure they can help your son with many of the symptoms your son is displaying.  The remedies have no side effects and will not interfere with your son&#8217;s medications but from my 28 years of use on film sets with crews and actors I can tell you they are effective.  If you cannot find a Homeopath i will find one.  Write me.</p>

					<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>do you know of any reputable homeopath doctors near Cold Lake? or in the Edmonton area? The trouble is that since Logan has been sick I of course have not been working much &amp; my small business is suffering. We are in a bit of a financial situation. However we will find a way. If you personally know of and homeopath doctors who could help us I would appreciate your help&#8230;thanks!</p>

					<p>I am 43, female , my symptoms did not start out severely, but ongoing since Dec 09, with different symptoms cropping out at different times.<br />
Now I am afraid my son my son could have been affected..He had cols and cogh constantly since Dec and he complained of stiff neck and back pain in May and had walking pneumonia in May and toda a month late, June he has a knee swelling and aching. His eyes have been red for over two months now.<br />
I had dry eyes and dry moth in DEc that lasted till MArch then, my knee pain and swelling started and then 3 weeks later I have pain in joints and muscles off and on.</p>
<p>I have a feeling my son will get the muscle pians and aches that I have three weeks from now in July.<br />
I will keep updating. I am very fearful of what it could turn into.<br />
Our symptoms have not been as server as everyone but seems like a slow onset.</p>

					<p>Hello everyone!<br />
Thank you so much for your comments &amp; support. We went to Edmonton to see doctors and have some tests done trying to get some much needed help and support for our family and our little boy who seems to be on a downhill slide again. On the way to Edmonton we had to pull over so Logan could throw up on the dide of the road. We went to see his pediatrician who won&#8217;t say either way if his symptoms are related to the vaccine. He stated Logans illnesses are very &#8220;mysterious&#8221; and wishes there was something he could do to help. Some more tests were ordered &amp; some referals for Logan to see a gastro intestinal specialist were made. The waiting list for us to see the specialist is about a year. In the mean time we justy have to &#8220;deal&#8221; with Logans illnesses&#8230;how do you like that?? There were no recommendations, no advice was given, there were no meds to help stop the vomiting or severe diarhhea. I handed my doctor a sheet that was printed off the health Canada website where it stated all the symptoms and side effects that should be reported for medical attention. Out of 27 of these adverse reactions Logan has 18&#8230;..18!!!!!! WHAT THE HECK IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THEM TO MAKE A CONNECTION????? Can someone please help us??? My son has been sick over 6 months and my business is suffering, we may lose our house &amp; we are in serious trouble due to the fact I haven&#8217;t been able to work because Logan has been so sick.

					<p>Aside form the walking pneumaonia, and knee swelling , I forgot to mention my son had runny nose and cough continuously since the flu shot in Dec and also complained of pain in teeth in May when chewing something hard, I got worried when he complained of nesquick cereal being hard the past month.<br />
something is not right.</p>
<p>Kristie, I do not know what we can do short of a protest to get someone&#8217;s attention.<br />
I have not had a respond from Siskinds lawyers, I will try to look for vaccine lawyers, they have them in the States.</p>
<p>Can you check out Dr. Rashid Buttar and call him? He is in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Has your doctor recommended him to a Rheumatolgist??? They are the doctors who treat most autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>My doctor has already referred me to one and I will see him July 13th</p>

					<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>First I want to thank Dee and others for creating this site and postings&#8230;..wow this is my first time reading these stories&#8230;.it breaks my heart to hear your stories especially the children&#8230;</p>
<p>To doctor means to &#8220;Heal&#8221;&#8230;..have we put too much faith in this medical system&#8230;who made them God&#8217;s?</p>
<p>I have had many years experience with vaccines&#8230;.working with Vaccine groups around the world who were started by parents whose children died or were damaged by Vaccines. I am also part of a group of health care professionals (doctors/nurses) who cannot work anymore!</p>
<p>The healthiest people of met over the last 20 years have been the people who were never vaccinated!!</p>
<p>Well I am so sad it has come to this but it is time we the Mothers- Women stand up against the medical establishment and Health Canada-who has been abusing us since 1927&#8230;.it is not Health it is Sick Care&#8230;and expose the truth&#8230;..remember we are the best doctors to ourselves and children and in the past we were the healers, midwives and herbalists&#8230;.</p>
<p>I have been working on a documentary which will be available in about 1-2 weeks called,&#8221; A Question of Sovereignty&#8221;&#8230;..you can watch the 2 min. trailer under the same name. This exposes C-6 and abuses of our government and Health Canada.</p>
<p>The truth will prevail but we must all come together now&#8230;.remember the POWER IS IN THE PEOPLE!!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having this page available&#8230;..my prayers go out to you all!</p>
<p>Candace</p>

					<p>I had the regular GSK Arepanrix H1N1 vaccination (adjuvanted) in mid-November 2009. I am female in my late 30s and otherwise healthy. I have had chronic injection-site issues from the start. In the first couple of weeks, I experienced significant pain, a large lump and bruising. This seems to cycle &#8211; I experience pain and then bruising at the injection site. Just yesterday (24 June 2010), the same area has started with almost constant (and isolated to the site) muscle twitching. This is 7 months after the injection.</p>

					<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Celebrated my 6 month hellaversary since getting the jab in Dec. Still dealing with many symptoms and relapses &#8211; the hardest challenge of my life. The only way to chart progress is month to month, very slow to heal. Set backs are demoralizing and hard to accept.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to the Tait family.  The medical community that insisted that we get this vaccine, just stepped aside when we got sick. In my case, I am suffering from Peripheral Neuropathy which happened after my immune system attacked the nerve endings in my central nervous system due to the H1N1 vaccine. </p>
<p>Just started a new job and don&#8217;t know if I can do it due to the ongoing flares and relapses. It is like a nightmare to deal with this all the time. My livelyhood could be affected and I am a single parent.</p>
<p>VERY FRUSTRATING &#8211; who compensates us???Who helps us???Where do we go for help???</p>
<p>Oh yeah: No one and No where.</p>

					<p>Hi Cathy,<br />
I went back and read many of your posts and your symptoms and feelings going through this are for the most part identical to mine.  I had a concussion in 2007 and had damaged nerve endings on the top of my head and that is why I think I was experiencing the burning and pressure on the top of my head.</p>
<p>What I want to tell you though is this.   I had a blood test and the results were that I was really really low in Vitamin C and D.  At the health food store I was told that my immune system  probably used up all my vitamins C &amp; D in fighting this.  So I started supplementing with powdered calcium ascorbate (vitamin C) and taking a sublingual vitamin D daily.  I also started drinking Bolthouse Farms juices which are just loaded with nutrients.  The ones I tried were the Smoothies called C Boost and Green Goodness.  The Green Goodness has wheat grass which is a pretty potent supplement.  Here is the link to Bolthouse Farms and they will tell you where you can buy it.  Some grocery or specialty stores may have it.  </p>
<p>I also started accupuncture treatments.  </p>
<p>Anyway, 3 days after I started supplementing along with the accupuncture, I noticed a remarkable improvement in my symptoms and with just over a week after supplementing my symptoms are almost all gone.</p>
<p>I hope this information helps and you give it a try.</p>
<p>take care</p>

					<p>I received the N1H1 flu vaccine shot in mid December 2009 as part of the normal Canadian vaccination protical. I had no adverse reactions to the vaccine til now, June, 2010, 6 months later. I have developed pollen allergies which I have never had before in my life. I have lived in the same place for the past 6 years and have no health issues. Now I suffer from acute pollen allergies which cause head ache, body aches &amp; pain, inflamed swollen sinuses, caugh &amp; sore throat. I have had these simptoms for aprox. 6 weeks and it is not a cold or the flu. The only change to my (immune) system is the H1N1 vaccine that I received 6 months ago. Corelation, cause, &amp; effect!</p>

					<p>The adjuvant listed in the GSK Prepandrix and Arepandrix vaccine inserts is similar to the adjuvant constituents developed by the DND laboratories in the US for the anthrax vaccine.  The old style adjuvant used a water in oil suspension to kick start the immune system into producing a strong antibody reaction.  However, there were serious side effects seen in the troops who received this vaccine (see Gary Matsumoto&#8217;s comprehensive analysis of Gulf War Syndrome in &#8220;Vaccine A&#8221;).  So, the Freunds adjuvant was re-formulated to include a oil in water suspension (squalene), plus a few other goodies like Polysorbate 80, and Vitamin E.  Back when I was born, they were still giving babies Vitamin E shots after they were born.  Vitamin E is good for the body, but not when injected into muscle or the bloodstream.  You can e-mail me for a copy of the E-Ferol Toxicity study that showed cancer in rats injected with E-Ferol (Vitamin E and Polysorbate).  Polysorbate has it&#8217;s own toxicity/carcinogenicity and is used as a surfactant (soap) in biotechnology and molecular biology studies (we used to use it with bleach to promote effective sterilization of seeds and plant parts for tissue culture research).  Squalene too has toxicity and immuno-hyperstimulatory issues as well and even in small quantities, these three chemicals combined make for a highly toxic, long acting poisonous cocktail.  Add in trace amounts of thimerosal (mercury) into the mix and you can add nervous system damage to the list of possible side effects.</p>
<p>The government of Canada (when it once had the Health Protection Branch) stated that there were indeed far safer alternatives to using adjuvant in vaccines and that these alternatives would be implemented into the vaccine program.  This has not happened, of course and the Public Health Agency of Canada continues to contract out to drug companies like GSK that have a long track record of causing injury to people through their so called &#8220;medicines&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have personally been stonewalled by the Prime Minister&#8217;s office, the Health Ministers office, the head virologist at the Saskatchewan Health Region and various other officials from whom I have demanded a straight answer.</p>
<p>I fear that the Taits will become a statistic (as we are all meant to be who suffer ill effects from the vaccines we are badgered and forced and scared into taking), and no justice will be found for their son.  It is my hope and prayer that they may find relief from the kindness displayed here on this site as well from doctors and researchers like Gary Null, Dr. Tenpenny, Dr. Mercola, and others who know the truth.  It is my hope that by uniting together we can expose the fraud that is Big Pharma, and regain control of our health and our lives.<br />
Please e-mail me if you are interested in any of the articles (I have over 50) relating to vaccines or to GSK.<br />
God Bless,<br />

					<p>June 26 2010: I want to report that I had the H1N1 adjuvanated vaccine in Kelowna BC last Nov 2009.  The first few days I had the typical significant pain in my arm but, 7 months later I still have significant pain in my upper arm around the injection site.  Pain is severe enough that I have difficulty rolling over in bed and throughout the day I take pain relievers to control this chronic debilitating pain. The pain  feels like a toothache in my upper arm.</p>
<p>Age 63 &#8230; excellent health.</p>

					<p>I wish to express my deepest gratitude to those of you who find the time to send blessings to our family. I become increasingly disgusted and horrified the more I research and learn about this horrible vaccine. It causes my heart such pain to see so many of us suffer with little or no help at all from the medical community who foisted this vaccine upon each and everyone of us &amp; has left us to suffer the consequences alone in silence. We have been reporting the 18 out of 27 side effects Logan has been displaying since dec/jan for months. So far it has done very little good. Our family doctor shut his doors in our face and refused to help a little boy whom he knows has chronic health concerns and immune dysfunction issues. How could anyone who claims to have the health and well being of his patients in his best interest do such a thing? Logan has been severely ill for 3 weeks now with constant vomiting and diarhea, yet no one wants to help him. Our pediatrician doubts our credibility and has asked us to take videos and pictures of Logans behaviour and bowel movements. He will be getting a video and pictures next week that would make your hair curl. It is heartbreaking to watch. I wish I could share it with you but I dont know how I could post it on here. I did post it on my facebook and it has caused heartbreak for many family members and close friends. I have done everything I can possibly think of. Contacted health link, talked with health nurses and medical officers for our region, wrote the news papers and news teams, got our story on the Edmonton news, emailed MP&#8217;s &amp; MLA&#8217;s, sent emails to health Canada, the minister and deputy minister of health. I have not even so much has gotten a response from ANY of them!!!!!!! Yet, in the news broadcast this Maria such &amp; such acting minister of health says they are taking all reports seriously???? THAT IS THE BIGGEST CROCK OF BULLSH@T I HAVE EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used to be so proud to wear the maple flag&#8230;.now I have no faith in this country after I have seen first hand how pathetic our Government officials really are. My husband immigrated to Canada from the UK and is so disgusted with our so called healthcare system that we are debating moving back to the UK where there is an abundance of doctors who care and want to help us. The bottom line is that our healthcare system and its officials care FAR MORE about protecting its credibility (whats left of it) than they do the health and well being of its citizens THAT IS A SAD FACT! The other sad truth is that doctors in this country have their hands tied up in the pharmacutical companies and can&#8217;t help even if they want to. We were told off the record by one particular doctor that wishes to remain unnamed that we need to get Logan to a naturopath doctor for help because NO medical doctor is going to touch this with a 10 foot pole. NICE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WE HAVE HERE IN CANADA EH? I say a prayer everyday that someone, somewhere is going to help each and every one of us. We have all been victims of an outrageous CRIME and deserve to be heard and helped. I will continue to write and get my story out there as best I can for my son &amp; everyone else affected by this unfathomable INJUSTICE! I would appreciate if each and every one of you contacted health Canada and told them of your life changing events since the vaccine. Also attach this link and ask them what they are going to do for each and every one of us????? STAND UP AND FIGHT!!! If we stand together we have strength! GOD HELP US ALL!!!!!</p>

					<p>I looked all over the health Canada website and couldn&#8217;t find anything about it. I did however write to the health minister again&#8230;not that it will do any good.

					<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to hear all your stories.<br />
I posted a few moths ago describing the symptoms that I have had sine Nov 2009. The suffering continues- chronic hives, pressure induced hives and overall inflammation and constant intching.<br />
They seem to be getting worse- back on Prednisone. This is my 4th &#8220;cycle&#8221; and the only think that makes my quality of life somewhat normal. My immune system is essentially attacking itself.<br />
I have been to specialists, allergists, immunoligists- had serious of blood work taken, nothing appears.<br />
All this 48 hrs after the vaccine. Somedays the swelling is so bad that the use of my hands is limited and feet so painful that I am unable to walk.</p>
<p>I hope that we all find the justice that we deserve<br />
This vaccine needs to be stopped and all of its horrible secrets revealed.</p>
<p>Bless you all.</p>

					<p>The effectiveness of squalene-like oils as adjuvants has been known for many years, but their use may result in auto-immune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and Guillan-Barre syndrome.  Currently, oil-based adjuvants are not used in vaccines for civilians in the US.  Instead, aluminum salts (phosphate, hydroxide), and thimerosal (ethyl mercury) adjuvants are used.  Some scientists believe “Gulf War Syndrome” was caused at least in part by Anthrax vaccines containing an oil-based adjuvant .</p>
<p>To dissolve an oil in water, a surfactant (detergent) chemical, such as octoxinol in the case of GSK’s H1N1 vaccine, must also be used.  Little research is avaialble on the synergistic effects of injecting oils, surfactants, aluminum, and mercury together.</p>
<p>In spite of evidence contraindicating the use of oil adjuvants, governments and drug companies are conspiring to scare populations into taking a poorly tested vaccine, risking widespread auto-immune disease. Drug companies stand to make massive profits and thanks to legislation enacted in 1986, will enjoy zero liability for adverse reactions [4].  Not surprisingly, a 2008 GSK study found no evidence for autoimmune disorders caused by it’s AS04 oil and aluminum adjuvant [5].</p>

					<p>Hi everyone. this may be of interest to Kristie and other sufferers.</p>
<p>I wrote an earlier post as I got GBS from my swine flu shot, had 3 stays in hospital since Christmas, and now have to use a wheelchair (3 months) to get around. I am not optimistic we wil ever get any compensation or acknowledgement from our govt, but my focus is on trying to get better now and do something legal within the two year window.</p>
<p>Browsing Health Canada&#8217;s website there is lots of good info on what the Cdn Health system has done to us. It seems to me that the additive squalene is the cuplrit. The US did not order squalene or any adjuvant in their vaccine, they just got the unadjuvanted version but Canada for the first time ordered 99% adjuvanted vaccine with a relatively untested squalene, and it was administerd to children from 3 -9 years old as well as 98% of the adult population.</p>
<p>Squalene s the chemical that triggered over 10,000 cases of Gulf war Illness when tested on US servcemen without their approval. There&#8217;s a website that lists all the bad stuff and problems with squalene at:<br />
 <a href="http://snardfarker.ning.com/profiles/blogs/squalene-a-history-of-vaccine" rel="nofollow">http://snardfarker.ning.com/profiles/blogs/squalene-a-history-of-vaccine</a></p>
<p>Go about halfway down where the squalene info starts&#8230; very scary stuff &#8211; here&#8217;s a small quote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squalene is a kind of trigger for the real biological weapon: The immune system. When the immune system’s full repertoire of cells and antibodies start attacking the tissues they are supposed to protect, the results can be catastrophic,&#8221; wrote Matsumoto. Dr. Pam Asa concurs with Matsumoto when she stated,&#8221; Oil adjuvants are the most insidious chemical weapon ever devised.&#8221;</p>

					<p>That is correct Chris and it was an oil based adjuvant which is highly untested.<br />
Here is the research I did.<br />
&#8220;To dissolve an oil in water, a surfactant (detergent) chemical, such as octoxinol in the case of GSK’s H1N1 vaccine, must also be used. Little research is avaialble on the synergistic effects of injecting oils, surfactants, aluminum, and mercury together&#8221;</p>

					<p>For Mette &#8230;</p>
<p>and his group of 25 Scandinavians suffering the side effects of the vaccine. How did you get together as a group. i think that&#8217;s what we need to do here in canada &#8211; have some sort of consolidated group that has a louder voice. As individuals we have little chance of getting any attention from media or government, and we can be dismissed more easily. </p>
<p>Because the USA &#8211; FDA banned squalene in 2004 they were smart enough to order the unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine and so we will not hear many horror stories on the adverse side effects coming from our neighbors to the south. It seems that Scandinavia and Canada were the principal global recipients of the GSK product with the squalene adjuvant.</p>
<p>I would like to include my email address mette if permitted on this site, and ask you to contact me so we can see how your country is dealing with the problems and maybe we can iorganize or collaborate somehow. I am at.</p>

					<p>Hello to everyone,</p>
<p>As one of my symptoms, on June 16th I wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;severe stabbing along nerves in my head; when I initially experienced this symptom I described it as a hole being drilled in my head.  It was when I read the side effects in the product information leaflet I was convinced all my symptoms are h1n1 vaccine related.&#8221;</p>
<p>WELL GUESS WHAT?  I got my cat scan results back and it is not good.  What is being described is in the same section of my brain as the symptom I described above, i.e. severe stabbing.</p>
<p>Cat scan report:  </p>
<p>FINDINGS:  In the posterior left parietal lobe, there is a 1.1 x 1.3 cm subcortical, intracranial hypodensity.<br />
OPINION:  New rounded hypodensity in the posterior left parietal lobe as described above is worrisome for intra-axial mass.  Further evaluation with contrast enhanced MRI is recommended.</p>
<p>I was told that this &#8220;mass&#8221; may or may not be a tumor.  Well, if it&#8217;s not a tumor, I think it&#8217;s a hole in my brain.</p>
<p>The CT report was compared to a previous CT July/09 and MRI April/ 09 and this &#8220;mass&#8221; was not there.  My vaccine symptoms started shortly after I got the shot  so I know this &#8220;mass&#8221; was caused by it.  Too coincidental if you ask me.</p>
<p>Does anyone here know how and why squalene was added to our vaccine?</p>
<p>Thank you all for listening.</p>
<p>regards</p>

					<p>Anna , I am very sorry to hear that.<br />
I did read squalene causes cysts too. So it might be a cyst.<br />
Squalene was used as an adjuvant .</p>
<p>Please search CBC there is a history about the vaccine.<br />
I also found that the Govt is liable to pay for damages.</p>

<p>Taxpayers on hook for any H1N1 vaccine damages<br />
Last Updated: Wednesday, September 30, 2009 | 6:51 PM ET Comments382Recommend98<br />
CBC News<br />
The seasonal flu vaccine is not a contributor or a cause of severe disease from H1N1, evidence suggests.The seasonal flu vaccine is not a contributor or a cause of severe disease from H1N1, evidence suggests. (CBC)</p>
<p>If there are lawsuits over the H1N1 vaccine, it will be the federal government, not the vaccine maker, that picks up the tab for any damages awarded by courts.</p>
<p>Contracts between governments and vaccine manufacturers usually include an indemnity clause that exempts companies if there are problems with a vaccine, Canada&#8217;s chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, told reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>The provision does not apply, however, in the case of malpractice — if a doctor injects a vaccine the wrong way, for example.<br />
Seasonal flu shots and H1N1 risk</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said there appears to be no increased risk of severe disease from the H1N1 virus among people who received seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who have severe disease have the same rate of having been immunized with seasonal vaccine as the general population,&#8221; Butler-Jones said. &#8220;So the seasonal vaccine is not a contributor or a cause of severe disease or illness in those people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the federal government, provinces, territories and researchers are reviewing preliminary, unpublished research that suggests people in three provinces who received seasonal flu shots may be at twice the risk of getting a case of swine flu that doesn&#8217;t require hospitalization.</p>
<p>He hypothesized that perhaps people who got seasonal flu shots may have been more likely to go to their doctor to get tested for H1N1.</p>
<p>More information about an independent assessment of the research by international reviewers may be released to the public next week, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>The sooner that the review and the study are made public and can be scrutinized, the better, said an infectious diseases expert in Ontario.</p>
<p>&#8220;My opinion is it&#8217;s already out there,&#8221; said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. &#8220;It&#8217;s out there, and I would say it&#8217;s important to be as open and transparent as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studies in the U.S., Australia and Britain have not shown an association between the seasonal flu shot and getting swine flu.</p>
<p>Some provinces have delayed giving seasonal flu shots to most people, partly because of the unpublished Canadian research and partly to avoid confusion.<br />
Pneumonia infections</p>
<p>In the United States, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that many Americans who died with H1N1 also had bacterial infections.</p>
<p>A study of 77 patients who had the H1N1 virus showed 29 per cent also had bacterial co-infections. About half of these infections were streptococcus pneumoniae, which can be prevented with another vaccine.</p>
<p>For years, Canada has offered pneumonia vaccinations to people at risk from secondary pneumonia infections, such as seniors and those with weakened immune systems, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Some Canadians on the front lines of health care have expressed concerns about taking the H1N1 vaccine until more is known about it and the adjuvant it contains.</p>
<p>The adjuvant is added to the vaccine to boost the immune response in people who are vaccinated. It may also provide some immunity if the virus mutates, said Butler-Jones, adding he has &#8220;no hesitancy&#8221; about the adjuvant.</p>
<p>Federal health officials said the risks from the vaccine are theoretical while the risk of severe disease and even death from H1N1 are too real to ignore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s each individual&#8217;s decision,&#8221; Butler-Jones said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not sure how I could counsel my family against getting something that would protect them and then watch one of my children die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine could increase side-effects such as a sore arm or fever. Clinical trials to date have not picked up anything more severe.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, health officials in Nunavut announced they will not give seasonal flu shots this fall and will decide whether to offer the shots later after the pandemic vaccination campaign has ended, depending on whether seasonal flu viruses are circulating at</p>

					<p>I posted here back in January.  My problem seems insignificant compared to some of you.<br />
I suffer from alopecia, an auto-immune condition that causes loss of hair, it started 2 weeks after getting the adjuvanted vaccine.  I also believe the cause is the squalene adjuvant.  </p>
<p>   The following link points to a list of recommendations to mitigate the impact of the H1N1 vaccine:<br />

					<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to let all of you know that Logans MRI &amp; EEG have all come back &amp; were &#8220;normal&#8221; however Logan still continues to have intense headaches which are on the top of his forhead. He says it feels like his hair hurts on the inside. He still also has episodes where he says his feet and hands feel like they have beads in them (tingling &amp; numbness) his behaviour also continues to be a major concern, episodes of extreme rage and serious depression where he reports he wants to die. This has been heartbreaking for us. I was wondering if anyone heard back from the lawyer some of us have contacted? I was wondering also if anyone has heard back from any government or healthcare officials?? CTV news has contacted us again and wanted to know what response we have had from the health officials&#8230;well sadly NONE!  I have emailed them again and included this link and asked them to read all of the stories here &amp; asked them to please help all of us. I hope you are all doing as well as to be expected and I pray that we don&#8217;t give up the fight for justice!</p>
<p>Bless you all</p>
<p>Kristie</p>

					<p>I received an H1N1 shot Oct 2009. It didn&#8217;t bother me much, except that I was extremely tired. Within a few days both hips and wrists became sore. When my left hip did not recover, I went to my family doc. An xray was taken which showed arthritis and joint wear. I asked for physio because I&#8217;d  had previously good results. Five sessions later, the therapist discharged me disappointed in little progress. I left with good exercise ideas.<br />
A month ago I started with a chiropractor who has great knowledge of how the body reacts to foods. He began to massage &#8216;adhesions&#8217; or scar tissue which was causing pain during hip motion, and I am gradually regaining hip flexibility. I now have hope of being cured. It will take time and relentless exercise.<br />
What seems to have happened &#8211; the vacine triggered an immune response to arthritis already in many joints. Inflamation led to adhesions. In addition to massage, the doc recommends &#8216;non-inflamatory&#8217; foods (vegies and chicken/pork/fish) and fish oil daily. Gonna do it!</p>

					<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I continue to have extreme swelling and rashes- now hair is starting to fall out. More blood tests today and placed on Plaquenil with prednisone as my immune systems continues to attack my body..</p>

					<p>Hi John, your condition sounds like one of the symptoms described at the top of this website, i.e.<br />
• Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems)</p>
<p>I am sorry that all of us have to endure what is happening to us when all we wanted to do was help stop the spread of the flu.  And to think that I actually felt proud that I got the vaccine!!!</p>
<p>Are you having any pain associated with the swelling and rashes?  I seem to have a similar thing with pressure pain and rash on the top of my head.  My doctor finally admitted it&#8217;s a possible side effect from the vaccine and it being vasculitis.   He said he has had several complaints from patients.</p>
<p>I wish you well and hope that the vaccine will soon work its way out of our systems.</p>
<p>take care</p>
