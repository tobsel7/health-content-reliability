I am no   stranger in working out, I have been going to the gym for the past 15 years.   Doing the P90X program is intense, complete and powerful. This program is not   for everyone; if you never worked out before then this would not be for you.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2007-10-18   22:02:48</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Rodney</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   am a Non-believer in basically ALL info-mercials, and would\&#39;ve probably   never purchased this program, but my roommate did, and we started it a week   ago. I Played basketball in college and in Europe, and these workouts, using   the right resistance and following the steps true to form will kick your ass.   I love it, and the Plyometrics, I\&#39;ve done numerous in College, but these are   by far the hardest, I was sore for 2 days. This is a great program, and   although I\&#39;m trying to gain weight, and not lose it, this program is   phenominal. Just have to stick with it though, because you will want to stop   sometimes.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-07-11   09:40:01</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Josh</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   have to agree with Kenny, I\&#39;m on month 2 now and I\&#39;m probably in the best   shape of my life. I love the Kempo (punches &amp; kicks), it\&#39;s way better   than Aerobics. Also, I love the fact that you don\&#39;t really need a lot of   exercise equipment. I have a pull-up bar($30) 2 sets of dumb-bells ($30) and   a set of push-up bars ($15). That\&#39;s it!

Month 2 is the same thing   with dif workouts. I love this program, it reminds me of Bruce Lee\&#39;s theory   on fighting. He believes mastering 1 way of fighting is the wrong way but you   know them all. P90x is that way, you are not doing one type of workout but   several. The muscle confusion is also the most important factor of the   program. If you have ever worked out in the gym and did the same routine, did   you stop getting results and got bored? You won\&#39;t get bored in this program.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-06   12:53:35</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>charles</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   really dont see how the program works do you do 1 dvd for a week then go to   dvd 2?</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-05   23:28:21</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Dineen</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   have done 2 weeks of P90X and I already see results! I am already fairly   athletic but have gained about 12 lbs in the past few months. I have already   lost 5 lbs on the program. I follow the diet quite strictly though. Every   time I do a workout video I feel stronger. This is by far the best work out   program I have ever done, and I have worked with trainers. I am excited to   see what the end result will be.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-14   21:55:35</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>dmiles</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   have reviewed many different home exercise programs over the years and this   one is the \&quot;bomb\&quot;.

I   can\&#39;t wait to get to day 90 and see the difference.

Find what works for you and use it. But i\&#39;m just starting to get into   the p90x. It looks pretty good so far. I wonder how different or drastic is   the change/workout as compared to HIIT, )high intensity interval training) or   Turbulence training (as done by the actors in the movie 300)</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-16   15:47:46</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Kenny</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>Thanks   for the correction Aadil... I guess doing this is not becoming a master of   any type of workout. You just have to mix it up. I am one of the admins on   this site - I can setup some space for P90X users to add before/after   pictures if you like. I will add a poll to see if you are interested. I\&#39;m   finally starting back my P90x (2nd time). Summer will be here before you know   it! I\&#39;m in my first week and I already feel pumped. I haven\&#39;t been to my   gym in over 6 months and would rather do this program.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-18   09:47:43</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>clj</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>P90x   is an excellent program but I wanted to make one point: you have to be able   to commit to the time necessary: meaning on average 45 minutes to an hour   each day for 6 days. Also, for some, even if you pass the fitness test, it   may take you a bit to get through the entire DVD, just listen to your body   and work yourself up, you will get there. Lastly, you will see results   quickly but clean eating is important as well, I think after one week my   clothes were getting looser. Definitely a good program.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-21   11:47:31</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>John   Yi</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   think it would be cool to have a p90x poll to see if any interest on posting   pictures. Might be a good inspiration to people like me not in the total   fitness mode but would like to get there. p90x seems quite difficult if not   in good shape.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-22   13:22:22</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>X.Hines</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>Hey   guys, let me tell you another benefit of the p90x programs. I\&#39;m a very tall   and thin guy, it\&#39;s been that way all my life. I\&#39;m 28yrs old and was only   able to gain weight during my 8yrs of active duty. I lost 27lbs after I   discharged from the military over a 2 yr time span. This program took me my   body back to its familiar \&quot;guerilla\&quot; drill workouts. I gained 11   lbs of my former muscle mass in 3 weeks.

Week 4   you take out the weightlifting exercises and replace them with Core   Synergistics.(one of my favorites!) Month 2 - You replace the weightlifting   exercises with &lt;strong&gt;Mon-Chest,Shoulders and Triceps, Wed- Back &amp;   Biceps, (These are different workouts then the first month.)&lt;/strong&gt;   Again, week 4 of 2nd month, replace weightlifting with Core Synergistics. In   all, should be around 12 exercises. I hope this helps.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-28   08:55:48</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Woody</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>Kenny   Thats the answer i was looking for.

Out of the 6   days, you do 2 cardio sessions. Plyometrics and Kempo. You could substitute   your spin class for Plyometrics for example. I actually do not do Plyometrics   because it involves a lot of jumping and I have messed up my knees playing   too much volleyball in my 20\&#39;s so I substitute that day with either biking,   swimming or even Kempo. I highly recommend you do not skip Yoga or Kempo.   Both are very good workouts that really helps you go over that plateau. I   never thought I would ever say that Yoga was good until I did this program. I   also love Kempo - You really feel great once you are finish with the workout.   Also, If you are looking at maybe getting leaner you could always do a cardio   workout instead of one of their weightlifting days. It\&#39;s really up to you.   Good luck</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-01-31   19:27:06</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Gman</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>Hi   Tom, Kenny and I both run this site, I am glad you have found this very   informative for p90x.

You would just need to make sure and   do the 8 to 10 reps rather then the 11 to 15 reps while doing teh weight   lifting days(heavier wieghts). Also, I know this is a clich&eacute;, but you would   need to eat more carbs. With the different cardio exercises included, Kempo,   yoga, Plyo, you will be in your best shape of you life.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-02-22   12:25:16</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>MAtt</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   was wondering if you also do gym work outs with the P90X, like going bench   press and squats.

You would also need to eat a bit more. Your muscles will grow. Edro, It   really depends on what kind of shape you are in. 20lbs overweight is not that   bad :) . If you have worked out before then I would say it would be right for   you. The program doesn\&#39;t do any type of running. You basically do 6 days of   different types of exercises. As for passing the test for push ups, let\&#39;s   say you will be a master of push ups if you do the 90 days of p90x.

Would any one know how   much I would weigh in about 3 months. I\&#39;m really excited for this. I hope I   get to 170 or less. I was about 150 coming out of boot camp and that was   skinney.

I\&#39;ve played football for   my school so I\&#39;m no stranger to working out. I\&#39;ve also read about how hard   the routines are, but I think I\&#39;ll be able to stick with it giving the best   I got. I\&#39;m pretty excited, but I do have a few questions: 1. Will this   really improve my performance on the field? 2. I\&#39;ve read how there\&#39;s   different kinds of workouts (doubles, classic, lean). What exactly is each   for? What kind of results will I receive from each? 3. I honestly don\&#39;t want   to look too ripped like my governor Arnold, but I would like to look   buff/muscular. Any advice on that? I know I had more questions than that,   I\&#39;ll ask them when I remember.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-04-16   20:15:38</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Kyle</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>Hi   Mike, I believe your performance on the field will certainly improve. You\&#39;ll   find your flexibility and durability will show the most improvement, so this   will help you stay healthy during the football season. The different workouts   depend on your goals. The Doubles workout are for folks who want to get in   great shape pretty quickly. It works for athletes who are trying to prepare   for the season. If you have time during the day to do one workout in the   morning and another in the late afternoon, then Doubles is for you. The   Classic workout combines the muscle-building and cardio exercises   efficiently. This is what most people do since it\&#39;s very difficult to find   time to do the Doubles workout. The Lean workout focuses more on cardio and   fat-shredding. You still do a couple of days of muscle-building, but the   focus is on cardio. I think you have the ability to look great in 90 days. I   don\&#39;t think you have anything to worry about looking too ripped like   Governor Terminator as long as you\&#39;re not taking any unnecessary   \&quot;help\&quot;, if you know what I mean. The program will take you where   you want to be headed. You, and others around you, will certainly see more   definition in your muscles after 90 days. Just be sure not to just do the   workouts...The diet is key also.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-04-17   08:43:15</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Gabrielle</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   know someone asked about being a little overweight and starting this program,   but I am 5\&#39;1 and weighing in at 167 pounds.

Torrey, Very good question.   This program is designed to help you and your body type. The only thing you   need is a strong mind. I am on my 6th week. The routines are hard but Tony   explains before and during each workout how to modifiy if you are struggling   and how to add extra as you get more advance. Go to the forum and read some   of the threads and you will find people just like you and I doing this   together and helping each other with any questions. Hope to see you in there   with some more questions</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-04-23   08:34:35</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Joanna</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>P90X   is not for beginners. You can get a good idea if you\&#39;re ready by taking the   P90X fit test on their website to self-evaluate if you&rsquo;re ready for it or   not. My advice is to start by purchasing a lower level product such as Power   90. I started by doing Power 90. There are two different levels that take you   from not in shape to in shape. Also, I really see this as the exersize   portion of your program. For nutrition I went with Weight Watchers. The combo   has allowed me to lose 60 lbs and am in better shape that I\&#39;ve ever been.   Most programs will work if you actually do them; the trick is finding   something that works for YOU and your lifestyle. PS I don&rsquo;t work for them or   have any vested interest.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-04-27   14:23:55</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>richard</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>how   does this program work?

P90x comes with a stack of 12 cd\&#39;s in a case, each CD is a   specific workout, here is a few examples -Chest and back -Plyometrics(jump   training) -kenpo(Martial art) -Back and biceps -etc.. In the p90x box also   comes two magazines, one is the nutrition plan and the other, is the P90X   magazine, wich is all you need to know about P90x. Such as how it works, wich   workouts to do on wich day etc... This program is very well divided, its   three months long, thus, divided into three parts, each part is four weeks   long. your first three weeks of every part will be the extreme workout   phase,(six days per week) you have one cd (all around one hour long) to do   every day except one day off. after three weeks of taking a pounding you have   one week to cool down (you still have workouts to do , but they are less   intence). this week is called the recovery week. then, using \&quot;muscle   confusion\&quot;, just when ure body was starting to adapt, your workouts   will change, thus, giving your body a blattant slap in the face and screwing   it over, making it work harder. and this is why the program is so effective.   Im 15 going on 16 and I bought this to get me in shape for hockey season, it   sure as hell done it for me, im going into my second month and ive gained 7   pounds of muscle and my arms have gotten like twice the size they used to be.   This program is good for you if your a little overwight, would like to tone   up some body parts, or if your already fit and want to gain great muscle   mass, in other words if you want to be fit to the extreme, this is for you.

I know it is cliche, but I was up early on a Saturday   morning and saw the P90x infomercial. But it wasn\&#39;t until the second time I   saw it that I decided to order it. Finally it came, along with the chin up   bar, and bands. I only started a week ago and I have lost 2 pounds. Doesn\&#39;t   sound like much, but let me tell you this. I have never anticipated working   out everday like I do now. When I started I was 6\&#39;0\&quot; 214lbs I am only   24 years old. I have always been athletic, played sports all my life, but   ever since I got my new job 10 months ago I have put on A LOT of weight,   mainly because of fast food. You don\&#39;t have to be in the best shape of your   life to do this workout. It kicks my butt and I love it! But don\&#39;t just   count on the exercise you need to watch what you eat as well. It is hard for   me, because I have the biggest sweet tooth, but it is a must. I can\&#39;t wait   to start seeing real results. I have my before pics posted on my bedroom wall   so it disgusts me every morning I wake up and night I go to bed. It is a real   motivater. I hope you enjoy.

I   guess your initial shape and stamina will play a role, but let me tell you,   my wife and I started the workouts 3 weeks ago and didn\&#39;t have any major   problems following along. We\&#39;re both overweight - though, that\&#39;s now   changing :) We\&#39;re both able to follow along without any issues. Tony always   has a team and each one of them does a modified version of the exercises: one   harder, one easier. If you find the regular routine too hard, watch the   person doing the easier version. Bands are an alternative to chin-up bars;   that is, you **DO NOT** need both. You can get a set of bands from any store   carrying fitness equipment (even Wal-Mart) and they\&#39;re cheap. As for   dumbbells, I would recommend one set that gives you enough resistance to feel   it after, say, 15 curls but without the burn, and then one set that will make   your muscles burn towards the end of 15 curls (curls 12-15). These 2 sets   should then be enough for all your workouts. Regarding pregnancy, in my   opinion (I\&#39;m a guy and I\&#39;m not a doctor), many of the exercises are **not**   appropriate. Of course, some of the routines could be ok, but most will not   and you\&#39;ll just waste your money on a bunch of DVDs that will collect dust.   You\&#39;d be better off looking at something like Yoga for Pregnancy or Prenatal   Yoga. These will keep you fit physically and mentally, and will help you   during childbirth. Back to P90X. Great workouts! I found the Yoga DVD to be   the most challenging of all. So far, we\&#39;re able to do 45 min. of the 1.5   hrs.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-07-14   12:04:32</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Nick</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>On   an average what weight would you recommend to start off on the dumbbells.

I plan on starting on Monday. I   noticed in the classic version that you don\&#39;t do cardio x. Is their a reason   for this or am I just reading it wrong. Also do you need to drink the protein   shakes and the peak recovery formula. Does this make a difference and will I   still see the same results without taking this stuff. I don\&#39;t have the   drinks and I really don\&#39;t want to take any supplements. Any advice would   greatly be appreciated. One more question I bought the dvd\&#39;s off of EBAY. It   did not come with the 90 day calendar. Do I need this. If so what would I   chart on the calendar. Only because in the fitness quide it has the workout   sheets to write down how many reps you do on the exercises. Thank You in   advance.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-07-25   23:14:03</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Anne</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>Nick,   I started the P90X program this past March. The CardioX is used if you decide   to do Doubles, which I wouldn\&#39;t recommend your first time through, or, if   you find Kenpo or Plyo too difficult, you could substitute with CardioX. As   far as recovery drinks and protein shakes,this is optional. Sometimes I\&#39;ll   add a little powder like Propel to my water. I always work out as soon as I   get up, then I have a protein shake for breakfast. I just use the protein   (whey) powder from Costco, then add soy milk ( I can\&#39;t drink milk) a banana,   some frozen strawberries,ice and a scoop of flaxseed (also from Costco).   It\&#39;s great, filling, easy to make and lasts for 3 hours. Plus, I can drink   it on the road. Don\&#39;t worry about the calendar. If you go to beachbody.com   you can download one. I actually typed out each daily work out, and put them   together in a notebook so all 90 days are ready to go. I\&#39;m on my second   round and added P90X plus. I love it. Nothing has done more for me than this.   Good luck, Anne</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-07-27   19:38:21</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>sam</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   live out of hotels and not also able to get to a gym is this something i can   do in a hotel on my travels?</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-07-27   22:48:57</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>derek</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>with   a set of resistance bands - one high resistance, one little lower resistance,   you can do every single workout they have. you will need some kind of mount   to wrap the bands around for the chin ups, but other than that your good.   everything else you can do right there, you may need to move a table here or   bed to the side, but it\&#39;s only for an hour or so.</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-07-28   08:51:25</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>John   Simms</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>This   program is MADE for people who live in hotels or travel...</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-08-01   11:32:21</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Mary</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   just saw this infomercial for the 1st time today and I was impressed.

When I say easy,   I\&#39;m not saying the ease of the workouts but how it doesn\&#39;t take a bunch of   weights, gym, and complicated excercises. However I\&#39;m not a big fan of   supplements other than whey protein. Will I get the same great results   without taking any supplements besides whey protein and just staying on a   healthy diet? After going to the webpage for P90x is started reading and saw   all these other products they were recommending. What are the bare   necessities I need that will give me the great results? I\&#39;m a discplined guy   so staying on the workout won\&#39;t be a problem.

Doing the workouts alone will help you   build muscle tone but you really to incorporate changes in diet in with this   workout. By changing diet, focusing on upping the metabolism by eating lean   portions more frequently I was able to drop 35 lbs in the first six weeks   while adding a whole lot of muscle. Going from one pull-up with good form to   sixteen.

If so , what   amount of reps should I be doing in order to achieve gains in muscle mass . I   have the cd\&#39;s , and looking at the videos (for example legs and back) it is   hard to see how you can build muscle mass while doing 25 or 30 reps for leg   exercises .</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>2008-09-16   18:58:12</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>             <div>Anne</div>             </td>             <td>             <div>I   am now in round 3, and doing a combo of P90X and P90X plus. I have already   completed 2 rounds. As far as mass building vs toning, there are different   courses you can select from the book, one for each. If you want to build   mass, then you need to choose heavier weights. What it really comes down to   is fat loss of your body. As you lose more and more fat, you will actually   see muscle definition. You could already have a 6 pack, but if it buried   under 2 inches of fat, you\&#39;re not going to see it. My shoulder and legs are   becoming striated and I have well defined biceps and abs now that I have   followed this program. For the teen question, yes you can do this program.   It\&#39;s not uncommon to have trouble with the pull ups. Use a chair to help you   and I guarantee that if you stick with it, in time you will be able to crank   out pull ups unassisted. Follow the eating program! With these exercise and   this way of eating, the fat will melt off. But, you have to be consistent.   Most importantly, take pictures at day 1, day 30 ,day 45 and day 90. This   really helps you actually see the results.

If you do want to jump   right in to P90X, just don\&#39;t get discouraged in the 1st week. The moves are   hard and the workouts are intense. But, you\&#39;ll be amazed at how quickly it   whips you into shape. By the 2nd &amp; 3rd weeks you\&#39;ll be doing moves that   you thought impossible in the beginning. Jair - the only workout that was   hard on my joints was Plyometrics. Non stop jumping for an hour! Be very   careful with this one. I have plantar fasciitis and had to stop Plyo and do   the Cardio workout instead. Good luck to all who want to start P90X.

Well i really want to do p90x but i hear it is big   around pushups and chin ups. I can only do 10 proper push ups and maybe maybe   1 proper chin up. So my qustion is should i start p90x now or stick to my   workout plan for awhile longer until i am in better shape to do p90x. I am in   no rush so waiting is not that big of a deal.

I was hardly ever hungry and felt like I was eating just so I could get the full 2,400 calories in. Should I drop down to level 1 or stick with number 2? &nbsp;<br />Additionally, the calorie number takes into account the peak performance protein bar and recovery drink. I want to do this naturally. What do these products contain? If I opt out, what alternatives should I seek? &nbsp;<br />Another problem I am having concerns the protein servings. Soy milk is listed as dairy and soy burgers are listed as protein. They are both made of soy, does this mean soy products can interchange between dairy and protein? Level two recommends 7 servings of protein. That is way too much meat for me to eat in one day and my budget is tight(college student). How can I get more protein in my diet?</td></tr></table><a name='akocomment932'></a><table width='100%' border='0' cellspacing='3' cellpadding='3'><tr class='sectiontableentry2'><td valign='top'><b>3. </b><b>P90X meal plan</b><br /><span class='small'>Written by <b>

When Tony went into the heavy pullup moves, I simply took out my old chest spring cables (yes, most people don't even know what they are...) and performed a variety of moves with them instead of re-herniating my L2-L3 disks and re-rupturing my C5-C6 plated &amp; fused neck.&nbsp;<br />It's really that simple: if you are older or have some limiting congenital defects, then use COMMON SENSE and find a workaround.

There are some great tips and lots of answers... The P90X program has good cardio routines. Kenpo, Plyometrics are two of them. As for your g/f doing pull-ups, have her do resistance pull-ups first (go up on a chair and slowly go down). It's hard at first but before you know it, you'll love the program!</td></tr></table><a name='akocomment607'></a><table width='100%' border='0' cellspacing='3' cellpadding='3'><tr class='sectiontableentry1'><td valign='top'><b>16. </b><span class='small'>Written by <b>

I tested myself and I can only run flatout for 1/2 mile, as apposed to 2 mile in my HS days, but I feel dead afterwards.
