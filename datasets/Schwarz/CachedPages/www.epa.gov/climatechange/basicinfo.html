    <h5>Climate Change or Global Warming?</h5>
    <p>The term climate change is often used interchangeably with the term global warming,
	    but according to the National Academy of Sciences, "the phrase 'climate
	    change' is growing in preferred use to 'global warming' because
    it helps convey that there are [other] changes in addition to rising temperatures."</p>
    <p><strong>Climate change</strong> refers to any significant change in measures of climate
	    (such as temperature, precipitation, or wind) lasting for an extended
    period (decades or longer). Climate change may result from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>natural factors, such as changes in the sun's intensity or slow changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun;</li>
	  <li>natural processes within the climate system (e.g. changes in ocean circulation);</li>
	  <li>human activities that change the atmosphere's composition (e.g. through burning fossil fuels) and the land surface (e.g. deforestation, reforestation, urbanization, desertification, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Global warming</strong> is an average increase
	    in the temperature of the atmosphere near the Earth's surface and in
	    the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/glossary.html#Troposphere">troposphere</a>, which can contribute
	    to changes in global climate patterns. Global warming can occur from
	    a variety of causes, both natural and human induced. In common usage, "global
	    warming" often refers to the warming that can occur as a result of
    increased emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities.</p>
	</div>
    </div>
    
<p>The Earth's climate has changed many times during the planet's history, with events ranging from ice ages to long periods of warmth. Historically, natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth's orbit, and the amount of energy released from the Sun have affected the Earth's climate. Beginning late in the 18th century, human activities associated with the Industrial Revolution have also changed the composition of the atmosphere and therefore very likely are influencing the Earth's climate.</p>

    <p style="clear:left;">The EPA climate change website has four main sections on climate change issues and  another section on &quot;What You Can Do&quot; to reduce your contribution. A &quot;<a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/index.html">Frequent Questions</a>&quot; section is available, and EPA has provided a <a href="http://climatechange.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/climatechange.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php">frequent questions database</a> where users can search for more specific questions and answers on climate change. An eight-page brochure entitled<a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/downloads/Climate_Basics.pdf"> Frequently Asked Questions About  Global Warming and Climate Change: Back to Basics (PDF)</a> <span class="fileinfo">(8 pp, 1.6MB, <a href="http://www.epa.gov/epahome/pdf.html">About PDF</a>)</span> provides illustrated answers to frequent questions.</p>
    <h5><a href="#science">Science</a> | <a href="#policy">U.S. Climate Policy</a> | <a href="#emissions">Greenhouse Gas Emissions</a> | <a href="#effects">Health and Environmental Effects</a> | <a href="#wycd">What You Can Do</a></h5>
  <h5><a name="science"></a>Science</h5>
  <p>For over the past 200 years, the burning of fossil fuels, such as
	  coal and oil, and deforestation have caused the concentrations of heat-trapping "greenhouse
	  gases" to increase significantly in our atmosphere. These gases prevent
  heat from escaping to space, somewhat like the glass panels of a greenhouse.</p>
  <p>Greenhouse	  gases are necessary to life as we know it, because they keep the planet's	  surface warmer than it otherwise would be. But, as the concentrations of	  these gases continue to increase in the atmosphere, the	  Earth's temperature is climbing above past levels. According to 	  NOAA and NASA data, the Earth's average surface temperature has increased	  by about 1.2 to 1.4&ordm;F  in the last 100 years. The eight warmest years on record (since 1850) have all occurred since  1998, with the warmest year being 2005.  Most of the warming in recent decades is very likely the result of human activities. Other aspects of the climate are	  also changing  such as rainfall patterns, snow and ice cover, and sea level.</p>
  <p>If greenhouse gases continue to increase, climate models predict that the average temperature	  at the Earth's surface could increase from 3.2  to 7.2&ordm;F above 1990 levels by the end of this century. Scientists are certain  that human activities are changing the composition of the atmosphere, and  that increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases will change the planet's  climate. But they are not sure by how much it will change, at what rate  it will change, or what the exact effects will be. See the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/index.html">Science</a> and  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/index.html">Health and Environmental Effects</a> sections of this site for more detail, or review the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/science.html">answers to some frequent science questions</a>. </p>
  <p class="pagetop" style="clear: none;"><a href="#content">Top of Page</a></p>
  <h5><a name="policy">U.S. Climate Policy</a></h5>
  <p>The Federal  government is using voluntary and incentive-based programs to reduce emissions  and has established programs to promote climate technology and science. This strategy  incorporates know-how from many federal agencies and harnesses the power of the  private sector.<br />
</p>
  <p>EPA plays a  significant role in helping the Federal government reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and greenhouse gas intensity. EPA has many current and near-term  initiatives that encourage voluntary reductions from a variety of stakeholders.  Initiatives, such as ENERGY STAR, Climate Leaders, and our Methane Voluntary  Programs, encourage emission reductions from large corporations, consumers,  industrial and commercial buildings, and many major industrial sectors. For  details on these and other initiatives as well as other aspects of U.S. policy,  visit the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/policy/index.html">U.S. Climate Policy</a> section of the site.</p>
  <p class="pagetop"><a href="#content">Top of page</a></p>
  <h5><a name="emissions"></a>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h5>
  <p>In the U.S., our energy-related activities account for over 85 percent 
	      of our human-generated greenhouse gas emissions, mostly in the form
	      of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. More than half
	      the energy-related
	      emissions come from large stationary sources such as power plants,
	      while about a third comes from transportation. Industrial processes
	      (such as
	      the production
	      of cement, steel, and aluminum), agriculture, forestry, other land
	      use, and waste management are also important sources of greenhouse
	      gas emissions
	      in
        the United States.</p>
  <p>For a better understanding of where greenhouse gas
	    emissions come from, governments at the federal, state and local levels
	    prepare emissions
	        inventories, which track emissions from various parts of the economy
	        such as transportation,
	        electricity production, industry, agriculture, forestry, and other
	        sectors. EPA publishes the official <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html">national
	        inventory of US greenhouse gas emissions</a>,
	        and the latest greenhouse gas inventory shows that in 2008 the U.S.
	        emitted slightly less than 7 billon metric tons of greenhouse gases (a million
	        metric tons
	        of CO<span class="epaLtSans">2</span> equivalents (MMTCO<span class="epaLtSans">2</span>e)
	        is roughly equal to the annual GHG emissions of an average
	        U.S. power plant.) Visit the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/index.html">Emissions</a> section
          of this site to learn more, or review the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/emissions.html">answers to some frequent emissions questions</a>.</p>
  <p class="pagetop"><a href="#content">Top of page</a></p>
  <h5><a name="effects"></a>Health and Environmental Effects</h5>
  <p>Climate change affects people, plants, and animals.
	  Scientists are working to better understand future climate change and how
	  the effects
	      will vary
	      by region
  and over time. </p>
  <p>Scientists have observed
      that some changes are already occurring. Observed effects include sea level
      rise, shrinking glaciers, changes in the range and distribution of plants
      and animals,
      trees blooming earlier, lengthening of growing seasons, ice on rivers and
      lakes freezing later and breaking up earlier, and thawing of permafrost. Another key issue being studied is how societies and the Earth's
    environment will adapt to or cope with climate change. </p>
  <p>In
    the United States, scientists believe that most areas will to continue to
    warm, although some will likely warm more than others. It remains very
    difficult
    to predict which parts of the country will become wetter or drier, but scientists
    generally expect increased precipitation and evaporation, and drier soil
    in the middle parts of the country. Northern regions such as Alaska are expected
    to
    experience the most warming. In fact, Alaska has been experiencing significant
    changes in climate in recent years that may be at least partly related to
  human caused global climate change.</p>
  <p>Human health can be affected directly
	  and indirectly by climate change in part through extreme periods of heat
	  and cold, storms, and climate-sensitive
    diseases
    such as malaria, and smog episodes. For more information on these and other
    environmental effects, please visit the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/index.html">Health and Environmental
    Effects</a> section of
  this site, or review the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/effects.html">answers to some frequent effects questions</a>.</p>

  <h5><a name="wycd"></a>What You Can Do</h5>
  <p>Greenhouse gases are emitted as a result of the energy we
	  use by driving and using electricity and through other activities that
	  support our quality
    of
    life like growing food and raising livestock. Greenhouse gas emissions can
    be minimized
    through simple measures like changing light bulbs in your home and properly
    inflating your tires to improve your car's fuel economy. The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/wycd/index.html">What
    You Can Do</a> section of the climate change site identifies over 25 action steps that individuals can take  to decrease greenhouse gas
    emissions, increase the nation's energy independence

 and also save money.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/">State and local governments</a>  and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/wycd/businesses.html">businesses</a> play an important role in reducing greenhouse emissions and greenhouse gas intensity. For example, major corporations, states and local organizations are taking action through participation in a wide range of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/partners/programs/index.htm#global">EPA</a> and other <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/policy/neartermghgreduction.html">federal voluntary programs</a>. </p>
  <p>You can start by assessing your own contribution
    to the problem, by using <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html">EPA's Household Emissions Calculator</a> to estimate your household's
    annual emissions. Once you know about how much you emit, you use the tool
    to see how simple steps you take at home, at the office, on the road, and
    at school
    can reduce your emissions. Visit the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/wycd/index.html">What You Can
    Do</a> section of this site
  to learn more.</p>
