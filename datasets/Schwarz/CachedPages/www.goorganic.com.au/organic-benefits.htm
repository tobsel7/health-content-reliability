          <p>The impact to the earth and the environment is lower. The animals, even being raised for strictly food enjoy a life (no matter how short) that is relatively stress-free, free-grazing on the land and not being manufactured in crowded and sometimes deplorable living conditions. </p>
          <p>Organic farmers use less energy, less water resources, and NO pesticides. Organic farmers rarely have to burn their fields, because their soil stays rich in content, moisture and nutrients due to careful management of land and using only natural organic matter to cultivate and grow their crops.</p>
          <p>When industrialized agriculture (union farms) arrive in farming communities, many farmers are forced out of business. Great expanses of farm land are swallowed up and a way of life that has sustained humans for centuries vanishes. Gone too, is the regard for animals. Placing the animals in crowded living conditions, not allowing them the freedom of movement, fed enriched grains and additives to promote quick growth, and all for what? All for greed. </p>
          <p>Each month dozens of new pesticides, cleaners, fertilizers etc&hellip; show up in local supermarkets and stores. These products, advertised heavily are purchased and used and thus the destruction of the earth continues slow and steady. </p>
          <p>Organic farmers, live cleanly. Free of pesticides and toxins. They do not clutter up the landfills with toxic waste or subject their bodies to unhealthy foods. It is a conscious choice. One made in order to survive right along with the planet that sustains them<br>
