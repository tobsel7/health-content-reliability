Controversy</span></b><!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p align="center"><font size="5">(See below for Update on Landis defense) </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">For those that 
missed it—I’ve talked to several—Floyd Landis won the 2006 Tour de France, the 
world’s most prestigious cycling event, overcoming a seemingly insurmountable 
8-minute deficit in the final days of the 3-week-long stage race. “He just 
proved he has incredible character,” Tour Director Christian Prudhomme gushed, 
according to <b>Sports Illustrated</b>. “The performance he had today is 
something I haven’t seen in 20 years.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Shortly 
thereafter, however, Floyd’s magnificent ride was severely jeopardized when a 
urine sample taken shortly after the comeback-stage 17 tested positive for 
testosterone<b>;</b> the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone was found to 
be 11 to 1, well over the 4:1 limit allowed by anti-doping authorities.&nbsp; 
“Scandal Overshadows Landis’ Rousing Victory,” the <b>Associated Press </b>
headlined. A few days later, <b>The New York Times</b> reported, based on a leak 
from an “unnamed person” at the International Cycling Union (UCI) “with 
knowledge of the result,” that some of the testosterone in his urine sample was 
synthetic, indicating that it was from an outside source. That apparently sealed 
the deal in the eyes of many doping experts.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Nevertheless, 
Floyd insists that he did nothing wrong. “I have never taken any banned 
substance, including testosterone,” he said in a written statement. “I was the 
strongest man at the Tour de France, and that is why I am champion.” It is 
probably not a good bet that the test results will be overturned, but I do 
believe that Floyd was the best and strongest rider at the Tour.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">If he took 
testosterone, of course, he made a bad mistake. He was wrong.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Each person 
will have to make up their own mind about Floyd’s guilt or innocence. I’m 
inclined to believe Floyd, but I have no way to know for sure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Here are some 
things to take into consideration, which aren’t getting much play in the 
mainstream press.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">About Testosterone</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">First, 
testosterone has a two-pronged effect<b>:</b> it speeds recovery and helps build 
muscle mass. For a cyclist one tends to cancel out the other. The last thing a 
bike racer needs is extra body weight, especially in the upper body, that 
doesn’t make him go faster or climb better. If you’ll recall, Lance Armstrong 
was a better rider after he lost weight. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Floyd’s 
longtime physician Brent Kay, MD, was asked about the benefits of testosterone 
for a cyclist on CNN’s <b>Larry King Live</b>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">“It would be 
my opinion that it would make it worse,” he replied. “I think that’s the crazy 
thing here. I think everybody really needs to take a step back and look at what 
we’re talking about. Because testosterone is a bodybuilding steroid that builds 
mass. It builds mass over long term use of weeks, months and even years and it’s 
crazy to think a Tour de France professional cyclist would be using 
testosterone, particularly in the middle of a race.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">That’s another 
puzzling aspect of the case. Floyd was tested eight times during the Tour, four 
times before the stage in question, and three times after, including three blood 
tests. Seven were negative. Only one came back positive, the one on the day of 
the big comeback.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">“Nobody in 
their right mind would take testosterone only once,” Floyd told reporters; “it 
just doesn’t work that way.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Steven 
Ungerleider, antidoping expert and author of <i>Faust’s Gold<b>:</b> Inside the 
East German Doping Machine, </i>agrees<b>: </b>“It would be totally 
inappropriate or completely ridiculous for anybody to use [testosterone] at his 
stage of the game…It would have no benefit whatsoever in a competition like 
this. It’s the wrong drug of choice.” (<b>The</b> <b>Wall Street Journal</b>, 
August 12-13, 2006)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Charles 
Yesalis, professor emeritus at Penn State and a well-know antidoping expert, 
says: “It would be like taking a cholesterol-lowering drug while having a heart 
attack.” (<b>WSJ</b>, August 12-13, 2006)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">An Agenda?</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The leak is 
another problem. Someone at the Cycling Union (UCI) leaked the news about 
exogenous testosterone being found in the test sample to <b>The New York Times--</b>before 
the result was made available to Landis or his representatives. Floyd had to 
read it in the press, and react without benefit of all the facts. It made it 
appear that he was changing his story with each new development. According to an
<b>AP </b>report, the drug cops at the U.S. Anti-doping Agency in Colorado 
Springs “absolutely won’t talk to the media about any case that is pending.” I 
guess they play by different rules in France.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">We now know 
that, UCI head Pat McQuaid was the leaker. “[He] said he had to release mine 
before the [French anti-doping] lab leaked it,” Landis told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">“This is a 
situation where I’m forced to defend myself in the media. It would never have 
happened if UCI and WADA [World Anti-Doping Agency] had followed their own 
rules,” Landis told reporters. “There’s some kind of agenda there,” he added. “I 
just don't know what it is.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Asked whether 
anyone had manipulated the test results, Landis replied, “I don’t have a theory 
on that. All I’m saying is that circumstantial evidence points to something 
other than just clearly enforcing the rules.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">It’s no way to 
run a railroad, that’s for sure. It does make you wonder what’s going on. Is it 
possible, as some have suggested, that someone in the evidence chain was tired 
of Americans winning every year?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Phil Liggett, 
the distinguished cycling commentator we see every year on OLN’s coverage of the 
Tour, is skeptical about the tests done on the American, according to South 
African sports writer Wilhelm de Swardt (<b>Beeld</b>, August 8, 2006). “The way 
the tests were handled and the information that was leaked to <b>The New York 
Times</b> makes me wonder whether everything was done according to the rules,” 
said Liggett.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The same 
French lab hounded Lance Armstrong for years. In May of this year, tests done on 
a sample of Armstrong’s urine in 1999 by that lab were thrown out after an 
independent investigation found that the lab “did not follow a single one” of 
the required handling techniques. (<b>WSJ</b>, August 12-13, 2006)&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The more I 
learn about testing for synthetic testosterone in the body, the more I wonder. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Synthetic Testosterone</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">As noted 
earlier, only one of eight samples tested by the French lab was found positive; 
the samples taken before and after Stage 17 were all negative. The logical 
question is how long does synthetic testosterone stay in the body? Carl Bialik,
<i>The Numbers Guy</i>, explored this question quite extensively in his column 
on <b>WSJ</b>.com (August 11, 2006).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">First, Bialik 
confirmed through Landis spokesman Michael Henson and cycling union doctor Mario 
Zorzoli that only the test on July 20 was positive. Tests two days before and 
two days after were negative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">How long it 
takes for synthetic testosterone to clear out of the body depends primarily on 
how it was administered. “Testosterone typically is injected directly into the 
muscle, and, depending on the dosage, it generally creates an elevated T/E 
[testosterone to epitestosterone] ratio for a week to 10 days, according to 
researchers I spoke with,” the Numbers Guy wrote. “That makes this form of 
testosterone usage an unlikely candidate to explain Mr. Landis’s positive 
test—assuming the tests were conducted properly—his elevated ratio would have 
shown up in one of his other tests.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Plus, as we 
pointed out above, testosterone doesn’t work that fast. “It takes at least a 
week to have a physiological effect,” Dr. Simon Davis, technical director for 
Mass Spec Solutions Ltd, maker of the testing devices, told The Numbers Guy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The other ways 
to take testosterone are by mouth or apply it to the skin with a gel, cream or 
patch. Unless we assume that Floyd and his handlers were stupid or uninformed, 
those methods also seem inconsistent with the test result that threatens his 
career.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">These forms of 
administration do work faster and clear out of the system sooner. Dr. Mario 
Thevis, professor for preventive doping research at German Sport University, 
told Bialik in an email, “Depending on the dosage, T/E ratios could return to 
normal after several hours.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The problem is 
that they provide little, if any, benefit. “These provide a very small amount of 
testosterone, and certainly would not improve performance at any significant 
level,” Simon Davis, who you'll remember works for the company that makes the 
testing devices, told Bialik.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">That brings us 
back to the credibility of the French lab and the accuracy of the tests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Carl Bialik 
found that the French lab has a generally good reputation. German Professor 
Thevis told him the lab “has fulfilled the accreditation requirement for sport 
drug testing for more than 15 years.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">There have 
been some stumbles over the years, however. We already mentioned the overturning 
of Lance Armstrong’s urine test because of defects in the lab’s handling 
procedures. Other problems have been reported as well. “In 1998, cyclist Paola 
Pezzo was cleared of a positive test by [the French lab], in part because of 
flaws in the lab’s testing procedures,” Bialik wrote.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The test used 
to detect synthetic testosterone, isotope ratio mass spectrometry, is considered 
reliable. “There have been a lot of studies showing that differentiation 
[between natural and synthetic testosterone based on carbon type] is absolutely 
reliable and reproducible,” UCI Dr. Zorzoli told Bialik. (8-2-06) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The test is 
not foolproof, however. “It’s a very complex test that requires very skilled 
people and is easy to mess up,” Dr. Richard Hellman, president-elect of the 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, told The Numbers Guy. Dr. 
Davis, technical director for the company that makes the machines that do the 
testing, agrees: “Quite regularly there are errors in the isotope tests,” Davis 
told Bialik. “It’s a very difficult analytical technique.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">No evidence of 
tampering with the test sample has been uncovered. But it would certainly be 
possible to spike the sample, says Dr. Davis<b>: </b>“If you did an analysis on 
testosterone, you wouldn’t be able to distinguish between testosterone injected 
straight into the sample, or coming out through urine.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">So, where does 
that leave us? I would say, <i>in doubt</i>. It’s certainly not time to declare 
Floyd Landis guilty without a hearing. Yet, a substantial portion of the media 
seems inclined to rush to judgment, especially sports commentators.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Phil Liggett, 
arguably the most widely recognized cycling commentator in the world, has not 
joined the media horde. According to the article in the South African online 
24-hour news service <b>Beeld</b> referred to earlier, Liggett has pointed out 
that the legal team representing Landis has never lost a case in which an 
athlete was accused of having testosterone levels that were too high.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">You’d never 
know it from reading your daily newspaper or watching the nightly news.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Rush to Judgment</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">A local sports 
reporter/commentator I generally respect wrote, “Maybe it’s a frame-up 
perpetuated by the same folks who tried for so long to discredit Lance 
Armstrong.” After barely pausing for breath, he wrote in the next paragraph. 
“But, no I don’t think so. Do you?” And that was when the ink was barely dry on 
the first reports of a positive test result, before the “B” sample results or 
the information on synthetic testosterone were known. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">About the same 
time, while the story was still unfolding, <b>AP</b> writer Jim Litke was out 
with a very negative report, the worst I’ve seen. Among other things, he wrote, 
“The evidence so far says he’d better have a good lawyer. …Make that a Great 
one.” Referring to Floyd’s explanations at that point, he wrote mockingly<b>:</b> 
“At least he didn’t say the dog ate his homework.” (July 28, 2006) (See below 
about the alcohol defense.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">I don’t like 
the tone of that; sounds like the case is essentially closed, at least in his 
mind. I know that lots of sports writers make their bones by being opinionated 
and having a big mouth, but I think some restraint is called for when an 
athlete’s life and career are on the line. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">“I don’t think 
he has much chance at all to try to prove his innocence,” three-time Tour winner 
Greg LeMond told a reporter by phone. That may be true, but it’s hardly 
constructive, especially when the appeal process hasn’t even begun. In fact, as 
of this writing, Floyd has yet to be charged by the U.S. Anti-doping Agency. 
Until then he is still the official winner of the Tour de France. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Even though 
these comments may turn out to be correct, I find them disturbing. Beyond the 
presumption of guilt, they feed into the pessimistic view that most successful 
people got where they are by cheating. Jim Litke, in the same column quoted 
above, referring to Floyd’s thrilling comeback, added this gloomy commentary<b>:</b> 
“For almost a week, that ride…made people believe there was no limit on how far 
hard work, toughness and willingness to sacrifice could carry a champion. Now 
it’s just one more reason to be skeptical about the next great performance.”
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">I believe that 
was overly negative, at least early in the news cycle when it was written—and 
generally misguided. People who work hard and follow the rules almost always 
come out ahead in the long run. Optimistic people who help themselves do better 
in just about everything. (See “The New Positive Psychology” and “Owners and 
Victims” in our Psychology and Motivation category.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">One thing is 
clear. No one should question Landis’ work ethic. Listen to his friend and 
doctor Brent Kay again<b>:</b> “Floyd is about as tough as they come. Having 
ridden a bike with him on a fairly regular basis in the last four years, I’ve 
seen that first hand. I’ve seen his training data. I’ve seen how hard he trains. 
His training is legendary in the cycling area. This performance he had [on] this 
big stage…was not unexpected. He has training data that compares to what he did 
that day and the big thing with that performance is that he is the only one that 
would do that on the first hill, the first of five hills. You watched the other 
leaders there with him, they had the opportunity [to do the same thing], and 
said no.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Floyd’s Alcohol Defense</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">We can’t close 
without a few words about the alcohol defense which the press has had so much 
fun denigrating. The Numbers Guy covered that too, in his August 2 &nbsp;column. It’s 
not a joke.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Depressed 
about bonking on Stage 16, Floyd Landis downed two beers and “at least” four 
shots of Jack Daniels. Probably not the best idea ever, but everyone would most 
likely agree that it’s understandable. Guess what? Several studies (five, 
according to Dr. Kay) have shown that alcohol can substantially raise the level 
of testosterone in the body. Here are the details, as uncovered by Carl Bialik’s 
excellent reporting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The first 
study was done two decades ago by researchers in the department of clinical 
chemistry at Huddinge Hospital in Sweden. It was a small study involving four 
subjects. They had about 10 alcoholic drinks over six hours, which was found to 
elevate their T/E ratio “by a factor of 10% to 50%.” The study was published in 
the journal <b>Clinical Chemistry</b>. “Our interest here was just to 
demonstrate that we would see an effect,” co-author and now a professor of 
clinical chemistry at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Ingemar 
Bjorkhem, told Bialik. ” We expected to see an effect.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Bialik found 
that a handful of other studies have confirmed the effect. The studies, however, 
are small and the size of the rise in T/E ratio varies widely. A 1996 study by 
researchers at the German Sports University found an average increase in T/E 
ratio of “300% to 400% among six female volunteers and an average of 50% to 100% 
among five males.” The men’s results ranged from a decrease of 40% to an 
increase of 300%. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">A 2001 review 
of literature by Simon Davis of Mass Spec Solutions, who was then doing his 
doctoral work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, 
“found alcohol-induced increases in the T/E ratio ranging from 30% to 277%.” The 
review was done in connection with a pending doping case and was not 
peer-reviewed. It was recently published online (without permission from Dr. 
Davis) and was cited by Bloomberg. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">“The 
information is suggestive, but it’s not certain,” Richard Hellman, 
president-elect of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, told 
Bialik. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">“Doctors and 
drug-testing specialists say the possibility that alcohol may profoundly affect 
the T/E ratio is one of several drawbacks with the test that’s caused Mr. Landis 
so much trouble,” Carl Bialik wrote.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The cyclist 
union’s Dr Zorzoli counters<b>: </b>”If the case is on the evidence of exogenous 
testosterone, alcohol intake doesn’t create exogenous testosterone in the body.” 
Maybe not, but it could explain the elevated T/E level. We’ve already discussed 
the problems with the finding of synthetic testosterone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#000000">
<span style="font-family: Arial">I don't know the standard of proof required in 
doping cases, but surely the burden is on the charging authority. it's not up to 
Landis to prove his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

the alcohol effect and other problems with the testing, Endocrinologist Richard 
Hellman, told Bialik, “If someone’s career is hanging in the balance, you don’t 
want to say, ‘There’s 85% chance the test is right.’ ”&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">I feel bad for 
Floyd. No matter what happens, I hope he can get his mind right and focus on 
rehabbing his hip without pressure. As most readers know by now, he’s been 
riding on a damaged hip for several years and needs a replacement. If news 
reports are correct, the surgery may have been done by the time this article is 
posted. </span></p>

even bigger story for Landis to come back and win again--on a new hip. I’d love 
that.</span></p>

Says Landis Defense Gaining Traction 
(11-27-06)</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial">Floyd is making another 
&quot;unexpected comeback,&quot; <b>Sports Illustrated </b>reports--this time in his doping defense. &quot;Last week the French daily <b><i>Le Monde</i></b> 
confirmed what Landis's agent alleged last month<b>:</b> The French lab that 
said Landis tested positive for testosterone during the Tour mislabeled his B 
sample,&quot; the magazine's David Epstein wrote.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial">That doesn't necessarily 
invalidate the test, but &quot;the mistake could cast doubt on the test results and 
bolster Landis's appeal to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency,&quot; says <b>Sports 
Illustrated</b>.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Arnie Baker, a retired 
medical doctor and friend of Landis, has analyzed documents from the French 
lab, and goes an important step further. In a slideshow presentation at the headquarters 
site for 
the El Tour de Tucson, Baker said, &quot;There is no basis for a positive test in the 
first place. How it got this far in the first place, I have no idea. But I've 
looked at the test, and to me, it's appalling.&quot; (<b>AP</b>, November 17, 2006)
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Baker said both urine 
samples, not just the backup 'B' sample, were misidentified at various times 
during the lab's handling,&quot; <b>AP</b> Sports Writer Bob Baum reported.&nbsp;
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the meantime, Floyd is 
busy rehabbing his newly resurfaced hip. A one month medical report by his 
personal physician, Brent W. Kay, M.D.,&nbsp; says Floyd no longer 
needs crutches and is riding one hour on the stationary bike. &quot;He has no pain 
and will begin riding on the road now with the goal of gradually building 
strength over the next 4-6 weeks to allow him to return to normal training in 
preparation for the 2007 Tour de France.&quot; (<a href="http://www.floydlandis.com/">www.floydlandis.com</a>)</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial">Floyd is rallying on the 
bike and in anti-doping court. In spite of early death-knell reports, it may now 
be unwise to count him out on either front, not yet anyway. Stay tuned.</span></font></p>

<u><b>Already convicted</b></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
Your article about Landis was terrific. Far better than anything I've read by 
any number of distinguished sports writers who have already tried and<br>
convicted him. R.W.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
<u><b>Landis victory no surprise</b></u></p>
<font id="role_document" color="#000000">
<div>
	Having watched the Tour since Hinault's final year, I've cheered on US 
	cyclists from LeMond to Andy Hampsten to Lance Armstrong and was familiar 
	with Landis' abilities from his days as a strong&nbsp;domestique on Lance's 
	Postal teams.&nbsp; The strength he displayed this year should have been of 
	little surprise to anyone with any knowledge of the sport. P.R.<p align="center">
	<u><b>Steroids don't make champion</b></u></p>
	<p><font PTSIZE="10">Steroids may enhance an athlete's performance, but they 
	do not turn a mediocre athlete into a champion the way the media suggests. 
	S.T.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><u><b>Deny, deny, deny</b></u></div>
<div>
	</font>&nbsp;<p><font id="role_document">Everyone knows about the hip 
	problem he was fighting and how he was struggling during the tour but made 
	this miraculous comeback in the final days of the race due to his 
	&quot;character.&quot; Oh and coincidence of coincidences that is when he tested 
	positive. I don't believe how anyone who follows sports today can be so 
	naive as to think these high caliber athletes, regardless of the sport, are 
	not using steroids or some other performance enhancement. It is all about 
	beating the test and if you get caught then deny, deny, deny. D.M.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><u><b>No dummy</b></u></p>
	<p>This scenario does not describe Floyd Landis who would necessarily be a 
	sophisticated athlete, familiar with the effects of all sorts of performance 
	enhancing drugs (how could he not be?) and intelligent enough to know that a 
	single dose of a bodybuilding drug could not possibly affect his performance 
	in any way...On the other hand, why would anyone bother to sabotage someone 
	who already appeared to be so far out of the running with an 8 minute 
	deficit? L.B.</p>
	<p align="center"><u><b>Word from Lance friend</b></u></p>
	<div style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif">
		<div>
			I have a friend who used to&nbsp;work out&nbsp;with Lance Armstrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave 
			me some&nbsp;insight as well and to him it also does not make sense. S.K.<p align="center">
			<u><b>What's with the hat?</b></u></p>
			<p>
			<font lang="0" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="10" size="3" face="Times New Roman">
			He appeared to the world days later with a cap on back to 
			front...and I totally agree with a highly regarded sports 
			journalist, who wrote an article to the effect that you cannot take 
			adults seriously who dress like that. I did not expect a suit...but 
			that cap thing is a pet hate of mine (highly subjective!), and any 
			man who is deadly serious about something so vital, and is fronting 
			up the media, just should not look like your average lout. R.S.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="center"><u><b>Trust But Verify</b></u></p>
			<p align="left">Excellent overview.&nbsp;I linked it into my blog 
			(Trust But Verify) that 
			collects Landis news at <a href="http://trustbut.blogspot.com/">http://trustbut.blogspot.com</a> 
			which you may find interesting. D.B. [<b>Editor: </b>Visit this site 
			for the very latest on the Landis controversy. You'll be amazed at the 
			detailed coverage<b>: </b>news, research &amp; commentary. Kudos to David for a 
			wonderful resource.] </p>
			<p align="center"><u><b>Ruined</b></u></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I sure hope 
			Floyd didn’t do it!&nbsp; The poor guy is ruined now, even if he’s 
			innocent. P.J</font><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
	</div>
	<p align="center"><u><b>Knows testosterone</b></u></p>
	<p align="left">Since I've been on HRT for 10 years, I know a thing or two 
	about testosterone. First, only a total moron would &quot;shoot up&quot; during a race 
	where he knows he's being tested after every stage. Landis is not a moron. 
	Second, testosterone does not have an immediate effect, especially the 
	epitestosterone to testosterone ratio. J.B.</p>
	<p align="center"><u><b>Floyd still champ</b></u></p>
	<p>I agree, maybe Floyd did do something foolish, but the information does 
	not add up. For now, I will still watch Stage 17 over and over (recorded on 
	DVD) and enjoy the great effort that he put in that day.&nbsp;I want bicycling to 
	be clean as well as anyone else, but think Floyd has gotten a raw deal 
	here.&nbsp;W.G.</p>
	<p align="center"><u><b>Heroes rare</b></u></p>
	<div class="Section1">
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;It’s hard to find 
		heroes these days. Lance and Floyd are on my short list. M.H.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
