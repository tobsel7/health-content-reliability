               Jackson. He was born August 28, 1958 - one of 9 kids. His father 
               reportedly nicknamed him &quot;Big Nose&quot;. <br>

               talented. Despite the current, sad stories about his lonely, sad 
               childhood, Mike grew up surrounded by famous people and an adoring 
               public. At age 5, Mike and his brothers were the amazing 'Jackson 
               5'. They played locally, then in New York and Philly. They were 
               &quot;discovered&quot; by Gladys Knight and pianist Billy Taylor 
               at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem. By age 11, Mike was a Superstar. 
               At age 13 he went solo and had his first #1 hit at 14 with &quot;Ben&quot; 
               (a touching love song to a rat). Who knew he'd get addicted to 
               plastic surgery, face accusations of child molestation and end 
               up America's Most Famous Sideshow?</font></div>

a big, infectious smile. He was humble and grateful for his fame and his fans' 
appreciation. He made hit after hit, celebrated music videos one after another, 
sealed obscenely huge record sales and contracts. He had unprecedented $ponsorship 
deals with Pepsi, and LA Gear Sportwear. People stood in line at 1AM to purchase

    sure he no one had a clue about his personal life but what did we care? He 
    was doing amazing, selfless things - contributing to children's charities

    famous &quot;We Are The World&quot; song to help African famine victims. He 
    was given the Heritage Award and praised by Queen Liz, President Reagan and

         belly white. He first denies this, then blames it on the medical condition 
         Vitiligo which causes people of color to develop light patches of skin 
         that lack pigment. Well <i>he </i>doesn't say this, his &quot;people&quot;

         clever use of the word &quot;allegedly&quot; to avoid a law suit) to 
         remove facial hair and keep that voice of his at the 12 year old boy

         the Spin of the misunderstood, picked-upon Victim instead of an increasingly 
         weird 30 year old man. He's creepy. People are making jokes that only

               again and now sports little teeny triangles for nostrils and a 
               sharp razor ridge you could grate cheese on. Popular opinion is

               get a little nose work done! and it's not national news! Sheesh

        professional photos we see of him! You mean all those photos of him are 
        retouched?! Say it ain't so! When he's caught in public it's quite a different

      artistry of the airbrush, wizardry of make up artists and the kind, magic 
      lighting of studio crafted reality. You can see the rumored (please note 
      inventive use of word &quot;rumored&quot; to avoid a law suit...) fake-nose-tip-prothesis 
      hanging off as well as the scars. The thin little beak nose of 1997 seems 
      to have expanded once again. It's hard to see a human being in there, and 
      it's amazing there are plastic surgeons who can mutilate someone like this 
      and sleep at night. I wish I had $1 for every ranting &quot;fan&quot; who's 
      accused me of altering this photo or airbrushing/faking the photos on this 
      page. I tell them that's called &quot;getting sued to oblivion&quot; &quot;, 
      if it were true on my part. All these photos are from fan or &quot;official&quot; 
      web sites or major publications and can be obtained by anyone willing to 
      use a search engine for an hour or two. Information on Mike's face, his 
      surgeries, his bizarre personal and public actions and the words of people 
      who have stopped covering for him fill ten of thousands of web sites. </font><br>

      news </a> brings Michael out of his Howard Hughes-like life and back into 
      the spotlight when he charges his record company, Sony, is &quot;racist&quot;. 
      That's why his &quot;Invincible&quot; CD sold 2 million copies; Sony didn't 
      promote him enough. He sez. We all get to gasp anew and ask the question 
      - WTF?! Seems he's had his nose fixed,,,WHEW! and just got out of bed. As 
      it is reported in the news it seems a bridge was built to widen the nasal 
      passages. &quot;Thank God!&quot; the headlines say. Poor thing probably 
      couldn't breathe! with those teensy bitty nostrils. Oh How Nice For Him! 
      Perhaps his singing will improve, since his last album was 70 minutes of 
      hiccups, grunts, fake crying and yips. One has to wonder why, with all his 
      money, he can't seem to find plastic surgeons who are capable of actually 
      doing plastic surgery. The &quot;fixed&quot; bridge appears as two lumpy 
      lines and not what say, just for the sake of argument, a plastic surgeon 
      might put in someone's face to create a nose bridge. Maybe this is a new 
      trend in Breath-Rite Strip implants? One wonders what those Jutting Gill 
      Bumps were on the sides of his jaw in 1997. Mike ruins his symmetry schtick 
      with mismatched, lopsided eyes and lipstick like my senile Aunt Margaret 
      wears. Music critics and even those in the record industry are saying OK, 
      quite enough from this goof. There is even a TV special in the UK asking

        - Michael got a new nose courtesy of Dr. Werner Mang, a German Plastic 
        surgeon. Not only is Dr. Mang a gifted genius, but he doesn't mind talking 
        about how he made Michael a new nose out of part of his ear. Just in time 
        for Mike's child molestation trial, so he's looking good. Except for wearing 
        white to court, and everyone knows you don't wear white after Labor Day. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000">So Dr. Mang says that Mike's 
        &quot;people&quot; in 1998 about fixing his nose, since it was rotting 
        off his face. Mang did the operation in the office of Michael's regular 
        plastic surgeon, the one who ought to be sued for malpractice. He took 
        a slice of cartilage from Mike's ear and slapped that puppy on his non-nose. 
        He stated that Michael has an obsession with plastic surgery and wants 
        to change from a black man to a white woman. He really said that, too. 
        I really like this doctor. He thinks like me! Michael's regular plastic 
        surgeon said that after every album, Mike had more surgery done and always 
        wanted a thinner nose. Michael, however, still claims he only had two 
        procedures done on his nose and nothing else. Not one thing. His face 
        just sort of &quot;squared out&quot; and, mercifully, he got a much better 
        wig.</font></p>
