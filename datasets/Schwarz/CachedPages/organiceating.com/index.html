other organic-related products. As we discover quality sources of organic 
products and eating organic, the intention is to showcase these new organic 
resources to our visitors. As we grow, Organic Eating will build relationships

organic products. Thank you for visiting us. Organic is a way of life. Live it!<p>

<b>Organic Food defined:</b><br>
Organic food is; food grown and processed without the use of genetic 
engineering, any sort of synthetic or artificial fertilizer, in other words real 
fertilizer. It is grown without use of all of the 'cides, referring to 
pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide. It cannot be grown or processed with 
antibiotics, preservatives, chemicals or use of radiation. Actually it sounds 
pretty good, and its sort of scary thinking of food being irradiated and eaten!<br>
<br>
This is true of a single ingredient food; beef, corn or a multi ingredient food 
like canned chili or soup. To be considered organic all of its ingredients must 
be processed organically.</p>
<p><b>Other Organics:</b><br>
Organic products are not strictly related to food. In fact, organic cotton to 
make clothing and bedding (organic cotton sheets) is a fast growing industry. 
Would you be interested in an organic mattress? That's right, organic mattresses 
for beds are becoming very popular with people working toward a less toxic 
environment.<br>
<br>
Other types of Organic products include: flowers, cosmetic and skin care 
products, personal care products like shampoo, and organic jewelry. Organic 
jewelry are typically made with amber, bone, antler (horn), and high-quality 
rock (stone).</p><br>
<b>Books about Organic Food:</b><br>
<i>The Organic Food Handbook</i> is a great read for those who know little about the organic food industry. 
<i>Organic Food: Consumers' Choices and Farmers' Opportunities</i> digs into consumer organic needs and challenges organic farmers' face.
