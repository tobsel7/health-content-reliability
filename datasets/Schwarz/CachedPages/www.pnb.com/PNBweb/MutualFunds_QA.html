													<P align="justify">The first advantage to mutual fund ownership, guaranteed 
														marketability, is very important to investors. It is the ability to get out of 
														an investment. Here, open-end investment companies shine. By statute, the 
														investment company guarantees to redeem the current value of a client's 
														investment within seven days. However, the investment company has the right to 
														demand a written request for redemptions. The second important advantage to 
														mutual fund ownership, professional management, stems from the fact that the 
														investment advisor or management company is much more knowledgeable than the 
														average investor. Professional advisors work full time managing portfolio 
														assets -a luxury few investors can afford when investing on their own. The 
														third advantage would be the fund's availability to diversify much better than 
														an individual could.

													<P align="justify">When a fund invests in debt, the IOU usually requires interest 
														payments at specific times, such as semi-annually. Similarly, a fund investing 
														in the stock of a corporation receives whatever cash dividends that company 
														pays. Interest payments and dividend income by law must be passed through to 
														the fund's shareholders - you. You can even have that income reinvested in more 
														fund shares. Also, when a fund actually sells a stock or bond that has 
														increased in value, the fund realizes a capital gain. Periodically, the fund 
														will distribute such gains to its shareholders in the form of dividend checks 
														unless you have instructed it to reinvest the gains.

														in many daily newspapers. For off-shore funds, look in The Financial 
														Times-London. The value of a share is stated as Net Asset Value (N.A.V.).

													<P align="justify">The main law governing mutual funds is the Investment Company 
														Act of 1940, as amended by the U.S. Congress over the years. The U.S. 
														Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) is responsible for regulating 
														mutual funds as well as most publicly-traded securities. Off shore mutual funds

												<TD height="15">
													<P align="justify">Unlike a bank deposit, the value of your principal can rise or

														principal to rise over time. The value of a fund depends on the value of the 
														securities it owns. Stocks and bonds fluctuate in value and therefore so do 
														mutual funds.

												</TD>
												<TD height="15"></TD>
											</TR>
											<TR>
												<TD height="15">
													<P align="justify">Because the value of a fund fluctuates, when you sell ("redeem") 
														your shares, the price may be more or less than what you paid for it. Just as 
														the value of your home doesn't always stay the same, neither does the value of 
														a mutual fund. If you sell your home soon after you buy it, chances are greater 
														you won't make a profit. The same is true for mutual funds. Most real estate 
														and mutual funds are long-term investments.

												<TD height="16">
													<P align="justify">Debt securities, such as bonds, usually pay interest on a 
														regular basis, just as people do with mortgages. The interest paid is 
														established when debt is originally issued. That rate reflects (1) the quality 
														of the debt - as judged by independent rating services as to how likely it is 
														the money will really be repaid; (2) the length of time for which the money is 
														borrowed - usually, it costs more to borrow for a longer period, and (3) the 
														level of interest rates at the time - for example, today interest rates are 
														low, so debt carries a lower rate than a couple of years ago.
													</P>
													<P align="justify">The value of a debt security can go up (or down) as any of those 
														things change. Most often, the interest rate level changes. If interest rates 
														increase, debt issued at today's rates will be less valuable; why would people 
														accept 6% when they could get, say 10%? Similarly, if interest rates decrease, 
														debt issued at today's rates will be more valuable.
