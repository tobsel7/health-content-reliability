 <p><strong>Any vaccine can cause side effects.</strong>  For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. Listed below are vaccines licensed in the United States and side effects that have been associated with each of them.  This information is copied directly from <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm">CDC's Vaccine Information Statements</a>, which in turn are derived from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/default.htm">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices</a> (ACIP) <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm">recommendations</a> for each vaccine.</p>
 <p>Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/ChildhoodVaccines/">safety</a>, and like any   medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize   a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into   contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.</p>
 <h3><a name="anthrax" id="anthrax"></a>Anthrax vaccine side-effects </h3>
      <h4>What are the risks from anthrax vaccine?</h4>
      <p>Like any medicine, a vaccine could cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction.</p>
      <p>Anthrax is a very serious disease, and the risk of serious harm from the vaccine is extremely small.</p>
      <p><strong>Mild Problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reactions on the arm where the shot was given:
          <ul>
            <li>Tenderness (about 1 person out of 2)</li>
            <li>Redness (about 1 out of 7 men and 1 out of 3 women)</li>
            <li>Itching (about 1 out of 50 men and 1 out of 20 women)</li>
            <li>Lump (about 1 out of 60 men and 1 out of 16 women)</li>
            <li>Bruise (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 22 women)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Muscle aches or temporary limitation of arm movement (about 1 out of 14 men and 1 out of 10 women)</li>
        <li>Headaches (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 12 women)</li>
        <li>Fatigue (about 1 out of 15 men, about 1 out of 8 women) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Severe Problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Serious allergic reaction (very rare &ndash; less than once in 100,000 doses). </li>
        </ul>
      <p>As with any vaccine, other severe problems have been reported. But these don&rsquo;t appear to occur any more often among anthrax vaccine recipients than among unvaccinated people.</p>
      <p>There is no evidence that anthrax vaccine causes long-term health problems.</p>
      <p>Independent civilian committees have not found anthrax vaccination to be a factor in unexplained illnesses among Gulf War veterans.</p>

<h3><a name="dtap" id="dtap"></a>DTaP vaccine side-effects<strong><br />
<font size="2">(Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis)</font></strong></h3>
      <h4>What are the risks from DTaP vaccine?</h4>
      <p>Getting diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis disease is much riskier than
        getting DTaP vaccine.</p>
      <p>However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious
        problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine
        causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p><strong>Mild Problems (Common)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever (up to about 1 child in 4)</li>
        <li> Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4)</li>
        <li> Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th doses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which the shot was given, for 1 to 7 days (up to about 1 child in 30).</p>
      <p>Other mild problems include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) </li>
        <li>Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10)</li>
        <li>Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These problems generally occur 1 to 3 days after the shot.</p>
      <p><strong>Moderate Problems (Uncommon)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000)</li>
        <li> Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000)</li>
        <li> High fever, 105 degrees Fahrenheit or higher (about 1 child out of 16,000) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Severe Problems (Very Rare)</strong><br />
        Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness</li>
        <li>Permanent brain damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.</p>
      <p>Controlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is also important if another family member has had seizures.</p>
      <p>You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an <em>aspirin-free</em> pain
        reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following
        the package instructions.</p>

<h3><a name="hepa" id="hepa"></a>Hepatitis A vaccine side-effects </h3>


<h4>What are the risks from hepatitis A vaccine?</h4>
<p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems,
        such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of hepatitis A vaccine causing
        serious harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p>Getting hepatitis A vaccine is much safer than getting the disease.</p>
      <p><strong>Mild problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>soreness where the shot was given (about 1 out of 2 adults, and up
          to 1 out of 6 children)</li>
        <li>headache (about 1 out of 6 adults and 1 out of 25 children)</li>
        <li>loss of appetite (about 1 out of 12 children)</li>
        <li>tiredness (about 1 out of 14 adults) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If these problems occur, they usually last 1 or 2 days.</p>
      <p><strong>Severe problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>serious allergic reaction, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot (very rare) </li>

<h3><a name="hepb" id="hepb"></a>Hepatitis B vaccine side-effects </h3>

      <h4>What are the risks from hepatitis B vaccine?</h4>
      <p>Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it.</p>
      <p><strong>Mild problems</strong> reported</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Soreness where the shot was given (up to about  1 person  4)</li>
        <li>Temperature of 99.9&deg;F or higher (up to about 1<br />
        person in 15).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Severe problems </strong>are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses.</p>
      <p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in the United States.</p>

      <h3><a name="hpvcervarix" id="hpvcervarix"></a>HPV--Cervarix vaccine side-effects <br />
        <strong><font size="2">(Human Papillomavirus </font></strong><font size="2"><strong>Cervarix vaccine)</strong></font></h3>
      <h4>What are the risks from HPV--Cervarix vaccine?</h4>
      <p>The HPV Cervarix&reg; vaccine has been in use around the world for several years and has been very safe.</p>
      <p>However, any medicine could possibly cause a serious
        problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine
        causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p>Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.</p>
      <p>Several <strong>mild to moderate problems</strong> are known to occur  with this HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reactions where the shot was given:
          <ul>
            <li> Pain (about 9 people in 10)</li>
            <li>Redness or swelling (about 1 person in 2)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Other mild reactions:
          <ul>
            <li>Fever of 99.5 or higher degrees Fahrenheit  (about 1 person in 8)</li>
            <li>Headache or fatigue (about 1 person in 2)</li>
            <li>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain (about 1 person in 4)</li>
            <li>Muscle or joint pain (up to 1 person in 2)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fainting:<br />
        Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking movements) can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls. Tell your provider if the patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision changes or ringing in the ears.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Like all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be monitored for unusual or severe problems.</p>

        <h4>What are the risks from HPV--Gardasil vaccine?</h4>
        <p>The HPV-Gardasil&reg; vaccine has been used in the U.S. and around the world for several years and has been very safe.</p>
      <p>However, any medicine could possibly cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p>Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.</p>
      <p>Several <strong>mild to moderate problems</strong> are known to occur with this HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reactions in the arm where the shot was given:
          <ul>
            <li> Pain (about 8 people in 10)</li>
            <li> Redness or swelling (about 1 person in 4)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>          Fever:
          <ul>
            <li>Mild (100&deg; F) (about 1 person in 10)</li>
            <li>Moderate (102&deg; F) (about 1 person in 65)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Other problems:
          <ul>
            <li>Headache (about 1 person in 3)</li>
            <li>Fainting. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking movements) can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. <strong>Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls</strong>. Tell your provider if the<br />
              patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision changes or ringing in the ears.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
      <p>Like all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be monitored for unusual
        or severe problems.</p>

      <h4>What are the risks from 2009 inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine?</h4>
      <p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could  cause a serious problem,
        such as a severe allergic reaction. But the risk of any vaccine causing serious
        harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p>The virus in inactivated 2009 H1N1 vaccine has been killed, so you cannot get influenza from the vaccine. The risks from inactivated 2009 H1N1 vaccine are similar to those from seasonal inactivated flu vaccine:</p>
      <p><strong>Mild problems:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>soreness, redness, tenderness, or swelling where the shot was given</li>
        <li>fainting (mainly adolescents)</li>
        <li>headache, muscle aches</li>
        <li>fever</li>
        <li>nausea</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days.</p>
      <p><strong>Severe problems:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare.
          If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. </li>
        <li> In 1976, a certain type of swine flu vaccine was associated
          with cases of Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome (GBS). Since then, flu vaccines
          have not been clearly linked to GBS. </li>

      <ul>
        <li> Fever (up to 1 person out of 6)</li>
        <li> Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20)</li>
        <li> Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare)<br />
          If these problems occur, it is usually within 7-12 days after the shot.
            They occur less often after the second dose. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Moderate Problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000
          doses)</li>
        <li> Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or
          adult women (up to 1 out of 4)</li>
        <li> Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder
          (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Severe Problems (Very Rare)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)</li>
        <li> Several other severe problems have been known to occur after a child
          gets MMR vaccine. But this happens so rarely, experts cannot be sure

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note"><span class="style8">Note: </span>The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately.

      <h4>What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines?</h4>
      <p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems,
        such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of the meningococcal vaccine
        causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p><strong>Mild problems</strong></p>
      <p>As many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines have mild
        side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given.</p>
      <p>If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4.</p>
      <p> A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a fever.</p>
      <p><strong>Severe problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare.</li>
        <li> A serious nervous system disorder called Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome (or GBS) has been reported among some people who received MCV4. This happens so rarely that it is currently not possible to tell if the vaccine might be a factor. Even if it is, the risk is very small.</li>

      <h4>What are the risks from PCV13?</h4>
      <p>Any medicine, including a vaccine, could possibly cause a serious problem,
        such as severe allergic reaction. However, the risk of any vaccine causing serious harm,  or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p>In studies, most reactions after PCV13 were mild. They 
        were similar to reactions reported after PCV7, which 
        has been in use since 2000. Reported reactions varied by 
        dose and age, but on average:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> About half of children were drowsy after the shot, 
          had a temporary loss of appetite, or had redness or 
          tenderness where the shot was given.</li>
        <li> About 1 out of 3 had swelling where the shot was 
          given.</li>
        <li> About 1 out of 3 had a mild fever, and about 1 in 20 
          had a higher fever (over 102.2&deg;F).</li>
        <li>Up to about 8 out of 10 became fussy or irritable.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>        Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are
        very rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few 
        minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.</p>

        rates of fever than MMR and varicella
        vaccines given separately. Rash has been
        reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever
        in about 1 person in 5.
        Seizures caused by a fever are also reported
        more often after MMRV. These usually
        occur 5-12 days after the first dose.</p>
      <p><strong>Moderate Problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare).</li>

      <h3><a name="yf" id="yf"></a>Yellow Fever vaccine side-effects </h3>
      <h4> What are the risks from Yellow Fever vaccine?</h4>
      <p> A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems,
        such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious
        harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>
      <p><em> Reactions are less likely to occur after a booster dose of
          yellow fever vaccine than after the first dose.</em></p>
      <p><strong> Mild problems: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given </li>
        <li> fever </li>
        <li> aches</li>
      </ul>
      <p> If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and
        last for 5 to 10 days. In studies, they occurred in as many as 25 percent
        of vaccine recipients.</p>
      <p> <strong>Severe problems</strong> (estimates based on passive reporting)<strong>: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Life-threatening allergic reaction (approximately 1 reported per
          131,000 doses).</li>
        <li> Severe nervous system reactions (approximately 1 reported per 150,000
          to 250,000 doses).</li>
        <li> Life-threatening severe illness with major organ system failure
          (approximately 1 reported per 200,000 to 300,000 doses, or 1 reported
          per 40,000 to 50,000 doses in people 60 years of age and older). More
          than half of the people who suffer these side effects die. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="modreact" id="modreact"></a>What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? </h3>
      <p><strong>What should I look for? </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any unusual condition, such as a high fever,
          weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious
        allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> What should I do? </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Call</strong> a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. </li>
        <li><strong> Tell</strong> your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. </li>
        <li><strong>Ask</strong> your provider to report the reaction by filing a
          Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
          form.
          Or you can file this report through the VAERS<br />
          website at <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov/">www.vaers.hhs.gov</a>, or by calling
        1-800-822-7967.</li>
        <li> <em>VAERS does not provide medical advice.</em></li>
        <li>Reporting reactions helps experts learn about possible problems with
        vaccines.</li>
