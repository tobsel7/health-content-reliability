											<h1>CARS Report to Congress</h1>
											<hr/>
                      						<div style="overflow:auto; height:290px;">
											<p>The CARS program achieved the objectives set out by Congress to increase automotive sales and aid the environment. In just a few short weeks of sales, nearly 680,000 older vehicles were replaced by new, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The nation's economy benefited immediately from this stimulus program, which caused a distinct upward movement in GDP and created or saved tens of thousands of jobs at a very critical time in the recovery process.

											<h1>Exception Process</h1>
											<hr/>
											<div style="overflow:auto; height:290px;">
											<p>On September 23, NHTSA issued an amendment to the CARS rule to add an &ldquo;exception process.&rdquo; A dealer may apply for an exception if it was prevented from submitting an application for reimbursement prior to the announced deadline (August 25, 8 pm EST) because of problems caused by NHTSA. The agency has identified two such problems:  password rejection, where a dealer incorrectly entered its user account password multiple times, was locked out of the system, and was unable to get its password reset; and transaction rejection, where a dealer&rsquo;s application was rejected for a duplicate VIN or customer ID despite the fact that the VIN or ID was never used in a completed CARS transaction.  A dealer may also seek an exception for other hardships caused by NHTSA, subject to a determination that they should be redressed consistent with the purposes of the CARS Act.</p>
											<p>The exception process is available only to dealers, and only to those dealers that have completed valid CARS deals and extended credits to consumers.  It is not available for reasons other than action or inaction by NHTSA, such as technological difficulties in the dealer&rsquo;s own systems or processes.  For details about this process, please view the link posted below.</p>

											<h1>Transaction Data and Reports Available for Download</h1>

											<div style="overflow:auto; height:290px;">
												<p>During the wildly successful CARS program, consumers turned in gas guzzlers and bought nearly 700,000 more fuel efficient vehicles in fewer than 30 days. For each of these CARS transactions, the dealer who sold the new vehicle was required to register as a participant and to enter the transaction information through a secure web site. Dealers were also required to submit certain documents to support their request for reimbursement. The review process involved checking both the transaction information and the required supporting documents.</p>

												<p>These <a href="http://www.cars.gov/carsreport">reports</a> contain the transaction level information entered by participating dealers for the 677,081 CARS transactions that were paid or approved for payment as of Friday, October 16, 2009 at 3:00PM EDT for a total of $2,850,162,500. Please note that confidential financial or commercial information and consumer information protected under the <a href="http://www.dot.gov/privacy.html" target="_blank">DOT Privacy Policy</a> has been redacted.</p>

									<li>To participate in the CARS program, you do not have to sign an agreement to pay back the dealer the CARS credit amount if the deal is rejected.</li>
									<li>You are required to leave your trade-in vehicle at the dealership and sign over the title to the trade-in vehicle at the time of the deal.</li>
									<li>The dealer must give you the new vehicle at the time of the deal.</li>
									<li>Your vehicle must be less than 25 years old on the trade-in date</li>
									<li>Only purchase or lease of new vehicles qualify.</li>
									<li>Generally, trade-in vehicles must get 18 or less MPG (some very large pick-up trucks and cargo vans have different requirements).</li>
									<li>Trade-in vehicles must be registered and insured continuously for the full year preceding the trade-in.</li>
									<li>You don't need a voucher, dealers will apply a credit at purchase.</li>
									<li>Program runs through Nov 1, 2009 or when the funds are exhausted, whichever comes first.</li>
									<li>The program requires the scrapping of your eligible trade-in vehicle and that the dealer disclose to you an estimate of the scrap value of your trade-in. The scrap value, minus $50 the dealer keeps for administrative fees, will be in addition to the rebate, and not in place of the rebate.</li>

					<p>The information contained in the file was entered by dealers and could be changed only by dealers (or by NHTSA under very narrow circumstances; see CARS <a href="http://www.cars.gov/files/reports/data-dictionary.pdf">Data Dictionary</a> for details) to maintain accountability. As a result, there are some inconsistencies. For some fields dealers entered the information in a variety of formats (such as some phone numbers with a dash and others without a dash) and in other cases the data were mistyped (such as switching two digits of the phone number). Two additional fields (trade-in insurance start date and trade in NMVTIS flag date) were optional and frequently have missing values.</p>
					
					<p>Three caveats are worth noting. The first involves the dates entered by the dealers. The CARS invoice date was a default date provided by the system when the invoice (transaction) was created, but the dealer could override with a different date. Generally, a valid CARS invoice date ranges from July 27, 2009, through August 25th, 2009. However, there are some valid dates outside of this range because of pilot testing before July 27th and transactions processed through the regulatory exception process after August 25th. The CARS sale date, the trade-in registration start and expiration dates, and the optional trade-in insurance start date also were provided by the dealer in the transaction form.  These transactions may have information that was mistyped by the dealer. In cases where the required documents submitted with the invoice indicated an eligible transaction but conflicted with the sale, registration or insurance dates in the transaction form, the invoice was accepted by the reviewer based upon the supporting documentation.</p>
					
					<p>The second caveat involves the vehicle identification number (VIN) for both the new and the trade-in vehicle. The VIN is a 17 character long serial number that uniquely identifies the vehicle and that typically follows a standard format. Both the new and trade-in VIN may contain mistyped information by the dealer, resulting in a VIN that appears to be nonstandard. For example, the dealer may have switched two characters or entered one wrong character such as a &ldquo;5&rdquo; in place of an &ldquo;S&rdquo;. In addition to mistyped information, some VINs may contain place holder characters entered by the dealer at NHTSA's direction to override a duplication error resulting from another dealer entering the same VIN by mistake or as part of an incomplete transaction. (Without this step, complying transactions would continue to be rejected.) It is also the case that some vehicles are titled with nonstandard VINs, and the trade-in VIN was compared against the VIN on the title. Finally, in some transactions it appears that the dealer may have reversed the new vehicle and trade-in VINs.</p>
					
					<p>The third caveat involves the vehicle categories and fuel economy (miles per gallon) for the new and trade-in vehicles. In some instances the vehicle categories of the new and trade-in vehicle or the fuel economy of the two vehicles does not appear to conform to the requirements of the regulation for a valid CARS deal. NHTSA is aware of these issues and continues to research and investigate. One reason is that the EPA updated the fuel economy data on the website at fueleconomy.gov in conjunction with the CARS final rule, which affected the eligibility of certain vehicles under the CARS program. Deals that had been completed based upon the old information were accepted as valid transactions even though the new information makes it appear that the transaction is not valid. NHTSA also has identified cases where the vehicle category was incorrectly entered by the dealer, which made the deal appear to be invalid, but the deal is valid under the correct category.</p>
					
					<p>NHTSA continues to review and research CARS cases for compliance. We are finalizing a data quality plan to identify and correct data integrity issues. In the instances described above where data issues involve the possibility of improper payment, NHTSA is investigating the underlying transactions and will take corrective action when necessary as part of our ongoing CARS enforcement effort.</p>
