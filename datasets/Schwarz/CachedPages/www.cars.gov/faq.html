									<p>May I receive or use more than one credit under the CARS program?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>NO. The CARS Act specifies that not more than one credit may be issued to a single person, not more than one credit may be issued for joint registered owners of a single eligible trade-in vehicle, and only one credit under this program may be applied toward the purchase or lease of any single new vehicle.</p>

									<p>Is there a set amount for the CARS Credit?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES. The amount of the credit is $3,500 or $4,500, and generally depends on the type of vehicle you purchase and the difference in fuel economy between the purchased vehicle and the trade-in vehicle. Different requirements apply for work trucks, which are large trucks defined by statute and unrated for fuel economy.</p>

									<p>Are there different CARS credit amounts for the purchase or lease of a new passenger car? </p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES. The amount depends on the fuel economy of the new passenger car and the fuel economy of the trade-in vehicle.  If the new vehicle has a combined fuel economy that is at least 4, but less than 10, miles per gallon higher than the traded-in vehicle, the credit is $3,500. If the new vehicle has a combined fuel economy value that is at least 10 miles per gallon higher than the traded-in vehicle, the credit is $4,500.</p>

									<p>Are there different CARS credit amounts for the purchase or lease of a new van, pickup truck or SUV?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES. The value of the credit given for the purchase or lease of a category 1 or 2 truck also generally depends on the difference between the combined fuel economy of the vehicle that is traded in and that of the new vehicle that is purchased or leased. If the new vehicle is a category 1 truck that has a combined fuel economy value that is at least 2, but less than 5, miles per gallon higher than the traded-in vehicle, the credit is $3,500. If the new category 1 truck has a combined fuel economy value that is at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the traded-in vehicle, the credit is $4,500.</p>
									
									<p>If both the new vehicle and the traded-in vehicle are category 2 trucks and the combined fuel economy value of the new vehicle is at least 1, but less than 2, miles per gallon higher than the combined fuel economy value of the traded in vehicle, the credit is $3,500. If both the new vehicle and the traded-in vehicle are category 2 trucks and the combined fuel economy of the new vehicle is at least 2 miles per gallon higher than that of the traded-in vehicle, the credit is $4,500. A $3,500 credit applies to the purchase or lease of a category 2 truck if the trade-in vehicle is a category 3 (work) truck that was manufactured not later than model year 2001, but not earlier than 25 years before the date of the trade in.</p>

									<p>Are there special rules for work trucks?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES. A work truck, which is called a category 3 truck under the CARS Act, is subject to special rules. Work trucks are not rated for fuel economy by the EPA. Thus, the eligibility of work trucks for the program does not depend on combined fuel economy. Instead, work trucks may only be traded in under the program if they were manufactured not later than model year 2001 and not earlier than 25 years before the date of the trade in. In addition, work trucks may only be traded in for the purchase of a category 2 truck or another category 3 truck that is of similar size or smaller than the traded-in vehicle. Finally, the Act provides only for a $3,500 credit for trading in a work truck.</p>

Go to <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/CarsSearchIntro.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/CarsSearchIntro.shtml</a> and, after reading the information and gathering the necessary information about your trade-in vehicle, click on "I'm ready to begin!".

After entering in all of the necessary information, your combined fuel economy will be displayed next to the words "Combined MPG."  The page will also display the vehicle category of the trade-in vehicle and whether it is potentially eligible for trade in under the CARS program.

								<div class="body-content">
									<p>MAYBE. Some trucks, such as work trucks, were never rated for fuel economy. For these trucks, age is the only criterion for determining whether they are eligible trade-in vehicles. If you have one of these trucks, it must be from model year 2001 or earlier, but also the date of manufacture must be less than 25 years from the date you trade it in, to be an eligible trade-in vehicle. Other restrictions may also apply.</p>

									<p>Is there a reason fuel economy is important?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES. Buying a fuel efficient vehicle is important because it can:
										<ul>
											<li>Save you money -You can reduce fuel costs each year by choosing the most efficient vehicle that meets your needs. </li>
											<li>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions - Carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning gasoline and diesel contributes to global climate change. You can do your part to reduce climate change by reducing your carbon footprint. </li>
											<li>Improve energy security and reduce oil dependence costs - Our dependence on oil makes us vulnerable to oil market manipulation and price shocks. </li>
											<li>Increase energy sustainability - Oil is a non-renewable resource, and we cannot sustain our current rate of use indefinitely. Using it wisely now allows us time to find alternative technologies and fuels that will be more sustainable.</li>

									<p>Is there a reason the list of eligible cars changed on July 24, 2009?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES.  In conjunction with the official launch of the CARS program on July 24, 2009, the fuel economy data was updated on the fueleconomy.gov and cars.gov websites. This information was updated to create more precise data for use in the new CARS program. Previously available mileage data on fueleconomy.gov was solely intended to provide estimated MPG ratings to guide consumers' vehicle purchases.</p>
									
									<p>Of the 30,000 vehicle model types spanning 25 years, the result of converting to the more precise data meant that an additional 86 model types gained eligibility while 78 no longer qualify.</p>
									
									<p>In 2006, EPA published new test methods for calculating fuel economy estimates that are posted on window stickers of new cars and trucks and on the website, fueleconomy.gov. These new methods, which took effect with model year 2008 vehicles, brought the miles per gallon (mpg) estimates closer to consumers' actual fuel economy by including factors such as high speeds, quicker accelerations, air conditioning use, and driving in cold temperatures.</p>
									
									<p>To make comparing mpg estimates for vehicles easier for consumers, we added a feature on fueleconomy.gov to convert the older label values for model year 2007 and earlier vehicles to the new "2008 Label" format.</p>
									
									<p>Some of these conversions were based on the original rounded fuel economy values, and were updated to be more precise in conjunction with the official launch of the CARS program.</p>

									<p>Is there a way to determine the classification of my trade-in vehicle and the vehicle I wish to purchase?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content">
									<p>YES. The CARS Act divides the eligible vehicles into four groups: passenger automobiles, category 1 trucks, category 2 trucks and category 3 trucks. The best way to determine the classification of your vehicle is to visit http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/CarsSearchIntro.shtml.  Be sure to have the following information available as this link will ask you to enter it to determine the classification of your vehicle:
										<ul>
											<li>Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)</li>
											<li>Model year</li>
											<li>Vehicle make and model</li>
											<li>Type of engine and transmission</li>
											<li>Fuel type (gasoline or diesel)</li>
											<li>Drive type (2 WD or 4WD)</li>
											<li>Whether your vehicle has a supercharger or turbocharger</li>
										</ul>

									<p>As background, the term &ldquo;passenger automobile&rdquo; excludes: (1) vehicles that NHTSA has determined are not manufactured primarily for transporting persons and (2) vehicles that are capable of off-highway operation. Vehicles not manufactured primarily for transporting persons include pickup trucks and certain vehicles that permit expanded use of the vehicle for cargo-carrying purposes.  Under NHTSA's regulations, there are two groups of vehicles with capability of off-highway operation. The first includes vehicles that have 4-wheel drive and have at least four out of five specified physical characteristics relating to ground clearance. The second includes vehicles that are rated at more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight and have at least four out of five specified physical characteristics relating to ground clearance, but do not have 4-wheel drive. Passenger automobiles are what are commonly known as passenger cars.</p>
									
									<p>A category 1 truck is a nonpassenger automobile. This category includes sport utility vehicles (SUVs) rated less than 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight, small and medium pickup trucks, and small and medium passenger and cargo vans.</p>
									
									<p>A category 2 truck is a large van or a large pickup truck, based upon the length of the wheelbase (more than 115 inches for pickup trucks and more than 124 inches for vans). If the vehicle nameplate contains a variety of wheelbases, the size classification is determined by considering only the shortest wheelbase produced. Note: some pickup trucks and cargo vans exceeding these thresholds are treated as category 3 trucks instead of category 2 trucks.</p>
									
									<p>A category 3 truck is a work truck and is rated between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight. This category includes very large pickup trucks (those with cargo beds 72 inches or more in length) and very large cargo vans.</p>

For some fields dealers entered the information in a variety of formats (such as some phone numbers with a dash and others without a dash) and in other cases the data were mistyped (such as switching two digits of the phone number). Two additional fields (trade-in insurance start date and trade in NMVTIS flag date) were optional and frequently have missing values.</p>
					
					<p>Three caveats are worth noting. The first involves the dates entered by the dealers. The CARS invoice date was a default date provided by the system when the invoice (transaction) was created, but the dealer could override with a different date. Generally, a valid CARS invoice date ranges from July 27, 2009, through August 25th, 2009. However, there are some valid dates outside of this range because of pilot testing before July 27th and transactions processed through the regulatory exception process after August 25th. The CARS sale date, the trade-in registration start and expiration dates, and the optional trade-in insurance start date also were provided by the dealer in the transaction form.  These transactions may have information that was mistyped by the dealer. In cases where the required documents submitted with the invoice indicated an eligible transaction but conflicted with the sale, registration or insurance dates in the transaction form, the invoice was accepted by the reviewer based upon the supporting documentation.</p>
					
					<p>The second caveat involves the vehicle identification number (VIN) for both the new and the trade-in vehicle. The VIN is a 17 character long serial number that uniquely identifies the vehicle and that typically follows a standard format. Both the new and trade-in VIN may contain mistyped information by the dealer, resulting in a VIN that appears to be nonstandard. For example, the dealer may have switched two characters or entered one wrong character such as a &ldquo;5&rdquo; in place of an &ldquo;S&rdquo;. In addition to mistyped information, some VINs may contain place holder characters entered by the dealer at NHTSA's direction to override a duplication error resulting from another dealer entering the same VIN by mistake or as part of an incomplete transaction. (Without this step, complying transactions would continue to be rejected.) It is also the case that some vehicles are titled with nonstandard VINs, and the trade-in VIN was compared against the VIN on the title. Finally, in some transactions it appears that the dealer may have reversed the new vehicle and trade-in VINs.</p>
					
					<p>The third caveat involves the vehicle categories and fuel economy (miles per gallon) for the new and trade-in vehicles. In some instances the vehicle categories of the new and trade-in vehicle or the fuel economy of the two vehicles does not appear to conform to the requirements of the regulation for a valid CARS deal. NHTSA is aware of these issues and continues to research and investigate. One reason is that the EPA updated the fuel economy data on the website at fueleconomy.gov in conjunction with the CARS final rule, which affected the eligibility of certain vehicles under the CARS program. Deals that had been completed based upon the old information were accepted as valid transactions even though the new information makes it appear that the transaction is not valid. NHTSA also has identified cases where the vehicle category was incorrectly entered by the dealer, which made the deal appear to be invalid, but the deal is valid under the correct category.</p>
					
					<p>NHTSA continues to review and research CARS cases for compliance. We are finalizing a data quality plan to identify and correct data integrity issues. In the instances described above where data issues involve the possibility of improper payment, NHTSA is investigating the underlying transactions and will take corrective action when necessary as part of our ongoing CARS enforcement effort.</p>
