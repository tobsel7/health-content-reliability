<p><font face="Parade"><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;Since

it’s introduction in the middle 1970’s, the Atkins Protein Diet has grown

to be one of the most popular methods of weight loss.&nbsp; It requires

a large amount of self-discipline and dedication but if done properly it

seems that people can lose a tremendous amount of weight in short period

of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also claims that Atkins dieters will experience

other health benefits as well.&nbsp; The Atkins Center for Complementary

Medicine is confident that their diet is the most successful means of weight

loss around as they teach patients to determine their personal sensitivity

to carbohydrates and manage their weight and health for life.&nbsp; They

have successfully treated over 60,000 patients who followed their diet,

which each subject experiencing some of the beneficial health effects as

well.&nbsp; </font><a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html">http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101/html</a><font color="#FF0000">Yet

other researchers argue that this diet is incredibly bad for the human

body and is not a means of losing weight and especially keeping it off.

everything but the meat...What is the Atkins Diet?</font></font></font></u></b>

<p><font face="Parade"><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">The idea of

the Atkins Diet is to cut carbohydrates out of one’s diet in order to lose

a significant amount of weight.&nbsp; An Atkins dieter is not to consume

starchy foods such as bread, pasta, potatoes, cereal, any foods containing

sugar, high sugar fruits and vegetables, and even fruit juices; Thus eliminating

many foods one would normally need as a part of the four food groups to

stay healthy.&nbsp; A dieter is allowed no more than 30 carbohydrates a

day; the equivalent of a few pieces of lettuce or less than one apple,

which is drastically less than the suggested servings for fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;

An Atkins dieter is restricted to eat only meat and dairy products, including

chicken, fish, and milk, and even bacon, eggs, cheese, and butter. In other

words, one can live on the most fattening foods, eating all the steak and

rib dinners that they want, and still lose weight. </font><a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html">http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html</a></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>The Atkins Diet

works in two main ways:</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1) Since carbohydrates are the first forms of energy burned in the body,

the body goes into ketosis and learns to burn the fat as energy because

it has no more carbohydrates to use. Ketosis is when there are no glycogen

reserves in the liver so the body breaks down muscle mass in order to make

energy that are necessary for brain function.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2) Because carbohydrates are digested quicker than protein and fat, one

can become hungry soon after eating a huge plate of pasta or huge bowl

of fruit.&nbsp; By eating only protein, one will feel fuller, longer, and

will have less of an urge to snack in between meals. <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html">http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101/html</a></font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>In addition

to losing a good amount of weight, an Atkins dieter may experience improvements

in health and overall well being.&nbsp; This diet supposedly improves cholesterol

and blood pressure levels, and helps alleviate some problems such as fatigue,

irritability, depression, chronic headaches, and some forms of joint and

muscle pain.&nbsp; Type 2 diabetics may also see an improvement in their

blood lipid profiles therefore having to rely less on their medications

to maintain proper health.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101/html">http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html</a></font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The people at the Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York

have done years of research in order to provide the world with safer and

healthier methods of losing weight.&nbsp; Dr. Atkins and his colleagues

claim that obesity has grown to 33% over the past couple decades proportionately

with carbohydrate intake, death due to heart disease has risen 10%, and

cases of diabetes are growing in near epidemic proportions.&nbsp; The Atkins

Center claims that “All of these conditions are linked not by the amount

of fat in ones diet, but by blood sugar disturbances and insulin disorders

caused by excessive refined carbohydrate consumption.”</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101/html">http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html</a></font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Researchers at the Atkins Center claim that humans rarely use body fat

as energy unless there is restricted carbohydrate consumption. </font><a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html">http://www.atkinscenter.com/diet101.html</a><font color="#FF0000">

They say that this restriction will cause anyone to burn body fat as energy

rather than carbohydrates. The researchers claim that the fewer carbohydrates

present, the more sustained the blood sugar level remains throughout the

day because sugar is always metabolized first.&nbsp; Cravings are caused

by blood sugar fluctuations that are aggravated by carbohydrate consumption.



<a href="http://www.msn.com/">http://www.msn.com</a>&nbsp; By cutting the

carbohydrates, a person’s blood sugar can retain a more even level throughout

the day, therefore he or she will have no cravings and refrain from in-between

meal snacks. Also, diets high in sugar and refined carbohydrates increase

the body’s production of insulin.&nbsp; When insulin levels are high, food

is more quickly turned into body fat in the form of triglycerides, and

high triglyceride levels are one of the greatest risk factors for heart

disease. By using the fat cells for energy one is able to cleanse the burned

stored fat out of their cells, thus causing the dramatic drop in weight.



<a href="http://www4.phys.com/">http://www4.phys.com/applications/HpyerNews/get/forums/affirm/70.html



</a>One of the questions regarding any diet is whether or not the weight

can be kept of when the diet is complete.&nbsp; The Atkins Center does

say that when one is satisfied with the drop in weight and is ready to

bring carbohydrates back into their daily diet at the previous level.&nbsp;

Even though the Atkins Center shows good proof that their diet is a successful

means of weight loss, many researchers oppose it and argue that is a very

unhealthy way of losing weight.&nbsp; The following are brief claims made

about the main arguments on the effectiveness of the diet.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- Some researchers claim that when a person is not taking in an adequate

amount of carbohydrates that they will have a lack of energy, therefore

they will be too lethargic to exercise and ultimately not lose any weight.

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

-Michelle Albers, PhD, RD, who is a Medical Team Nutrition Expert says

that the foods that are eliminated by this diet, especially fruits and

vegetables, are the ones that are proven to help prevent cancer and cardiovascular

disease. <a href="http://www.wfla.com/">http://www.wfla.com/health/272.htm</a></font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

-Robert J. Bolster, MD argues that the key to losing fat is to get a little

bit of everything.&nbsp; “Eat and work out enough to raise your metabolism

and eat COMPLEX carbohydrates rather than white breads and sugars. Eat

Raisin Bran, vegetables, and fruits over a bagel or pretzels; white breads

and sweets are the worst you can choose.

Heilbronn, Noakes, and Clifton (1999) studied the effects of energy restriction,

weight loss, and diet composition on plasma lipids and glucose in patients

with Type 2 diabetes. Thirty-five obese patients with type 2 diabetes were

placed into one of three low-calorie diets: high carbohydrate, high monounsaturated

fat, and high-saturated fat.&nbsp; All subjects were then followed for

a 12-week period with weekly tests on weight, blood pressure and blood

sugar levels.&nbsp; They found that diet composition did not affect the

amount of weight loss, but they did prove that the higher protein diet

caused reductions in plasma glucose levels, insulin levels, and blood pressure.&nbsp;

When insulin levels are high, the body turns sugars and starches more quickly

into trigycerides and therefore causes an increase in appetite.&nbsp; So

as stated by the Atkins Center, this studied proved that a higher protein

diet will help in the suppression of in between meal cravings.&nbsp; In

addition, this study helped prove that blood pressure can be lowered with

a higher protein diet which was also one of the supposed benefits of the

Atkins Diet.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whitehead, McNeill, and Smith (1996) studied the effect of protein in energy

expenditure when the body is at rest. They used four different groups of

subjects each with a different diet varying with fat, carbohydrates, and

protein.&nbsp;&nbsp; The participants were of varying weight and age between

18-67.&nbsp; The weight of the subjects in the fasting state was measured

every seven days and skinfold thickness was used at different intervals

to determine percentage of body fat.&nbsp; Sleeping metabolic rate (SMR)

was also measured for six hours every night. The researchers found that

all groups studied had a decrease in overall energy expenditure and sleeping

metabolic rate no matter what their diet was, but the decrease was much

less in the group with a high-protein diet.&nbsp; This shows that the higher

consumption of protein over carbohydrates and fats does increase metabolism

even when the body is at rest.&nbsp; Therefore, one can produce energy

and lose weight without the suggested consumption of carbohydrates, which

is the main idea of the diet.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Skov, Toubro, Ronn, Holm, and Astrup (1999) performed a study on weight

loss in obese subjects by replacement of carbohydrates by proteins.&nbsp;

They found that consumption of higher levels of protein do help obese people

lose more weight than when combined with carbohydrates.&nbsp; The researchers

mainly observed changes in body weight, body composition, and blood lipid

levels.&nbsp; There were two groups of subjects, one with a low protein

diet (15% of total intake) and one with a high protein diet (85% of total

intake).&nbsp; All food was provided by self-selection and compliance was

monitored by urinary nitrogen excretion, which measures the amount of protein

in ones diet.&nbsp; All subjects were told to continue their regular daily

habits and physical activity, even the consumption of alcohol in moderation

and smoking.&nbsp; The researchers found that weight loss in the high protein

group was almost twice as much than the high carbohydrate group, which

was mainly due to a reduction in body fat mass.&nbsp; Slight improvements

in blood lipid levels were also observed in the high protein diet just

as the Atkins Center had claimed for type 2 diabetics.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In 1996 a study regarding weight loss with a low or high carbohydrate diet

was done at the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital

in Geneva.&nbsp; Researchers wanted to find a way for obese people to lose

weight and cut the cardiovascular disease risk and keep the weight off.&nbsp;

Golay, Eigenheer, Morel, and Lehmann evaluated the effects of different

composed diets on weight loss and fat loss, and insulin levels were compared

as well.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Each of the two groups studied took in the same amount of calories but

group one took in 25% more carbohydrates than group two.&nbsp; Weight and

body fat percentage were studied in the 68 patients before, during, and

after the 12-week diet program by using skinfold thickness and bioelectrical

impedance.&nbsp; Body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and

waist-hip ratio were all similar in all subjects in both prior to the study.&nbsp;

In the end, neither diet proved to be a better means of weight loss.&nbsp;

The fat loss was inferior to the total loss, which means that the loss

of lean body mass was mainly due to protein and water loss.&nbsp; In addition,

insulin levels decreased largely and similarly in both diets.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This study contrasts the claims made by the Atkins Center on what makes

their diet work.&nbsp; They claim that insulin levels are maintained with

a high protein diet therefore decreasing one’s appetite; This study proves

that true, but it also show that a low-protein diet does the same and it

would therefore be unnecessary to cut carbohydrates out of ones diet.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Marckmann, Toubro, and Astrup conducted a study compared the influence

of two different weight loss regimens, one high carbohydrate and one low

carbohydrate.&nbsp; Thirty-six female subjects with an average age of forty-four

were placed into each of the two groups and given a specific diet plan.&nbsp;

Subjects kept a daily nutrition diary to keep track of carbohydrate and

fat consumption and adherence was also monitored by blood and urine tests.&nbsp;

At the end of the study, the researchers found that there was weight lost

among subjects in both groups and therefore no significant difference in

weight loss methods.&nbsp; The study did show that triglyceride levels

were 30% lower in the low carbohydrate dieters than in the high carbohydrate

dieters.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Parade"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Atkins Diet is obviously a good way to lose weight in a short amount

of time, but it doesn’t seem to be the best way.&nbsp; Even though it has

shown to be helpful to certain aspects of human health, there is question

as to what it will provide in the long run.&nbsp; In addition, when a person

brings carbohydrates back into their diet after reaching their desired

weight, they are required to over-exercise in order to keep the weight

off until the body exits ketosis; and a person cannot go their whole life

never consuming carbohydrates again.&nbsp; If an obese person is interested

in dropping a large amount of weight in a short amount of time, the Atkins

diet is the way to go, as long as they are ready to face the repercussions

when they complete the diet.&nbsp; Other than that, the best and most healthy

way to lose weight is to have a little bit of everything: protein, fruits,

vegetables, grains, and even fat.&nbsp; A balanced diet, accompanied by

daily physical activity or exercise, is the best way to insure good healthy,

steady weight, and body composition.</font></font></font>
