<strong>THE NEW DANGER OF USING AN ATM MACHINE</strong>

These are tough times for most folks these days, people are struggling just to pay their debts and keep their head above water, good people who work hard every day are having trouble with their personal debt management. While we all are trying to decrease our debt and practice better debt management habits there is a dirty underside of the economic crisis which is crime, that people don’t even realize they need to incorporate in their lives. <p>
	
In times of economic hardship it is unfortunate to say, but true, that crimes of armed robbery and other financially motivated crimes increase substantially, making all of us more vulnerable.
	 
Most people know there is some element of risk when using an ATM machine at times that aren’t recommended such as; late at night in a dark isolated location with someone loitering about the area, these are common sense examples of what not to do and most people would never use such bad judgment. Unfortunately, today you need to rethink your banking habits and practice due diligence when it comes to taking out your hard earned money from your local ATM machine. <p>
	
Comparative studies done during the Great Depression and other significant economic crises show a direct correlation to unemployment and rising crime rates within the United States, as misguided people who cannot pay their debts sometimes become desperate and resort to financially motivated crimes.
	 
This is not being offered as an excuse, but as a warning there are more people than ever out to separate you from your money and some are not particularly skilled at this profession which can increase the rate of violence. Therefore here are some new tips to help you avoid being a victim of a violent financially motivated crime:<p>

1.	Do your banking inside the bank; but have your keys handy when leaving and lock your doors immediately and leave, just because you’ve gone inside and its daylight don’t assume that someone could not be watching you to return to your car.<p>
2.	If you do outside ATM banking be as diligent as if you were doing this transaction at night, carefully check your surroundings and when possible don’t go alone, have an adult with a cell phone in the car who can call for help if something occurs.<p>
3.	During drive-thru transactions day or night practice all the above and watch your side and rearview mirrors with the doors locked, drive away if someone is approaching while your transaction is in progress, don’t wait for them to approach you, assess the situation from a safe distance and call 911.<p>
4.	Avoid night time ATM withdrawals at banking locations; go to a public ATM that is well lit with people traffic such as a grocery stores etc. even if you have to pay a fee, your life is worth more than $2.00.<p>

In these tough times we all have to practice wise money and debt management practices, part of doing that means being diligent in when and how you practice your banking practices. We hope this is an informative alert of how to hold on to your money, and to do it safely. <p>

<strong>WHAT TO DO OR NOT IF YOU’RE THE FAMILY BANK</strong><p>
	
The economy has affected most everyone today to one degree or another, and has put financial strains on families across the country who are trying to cope with debt management issues in their day to day lives. The rising unemployment rate has created another set of problems for Americans to deal with, the unemployed relative less fortunate than yourself.<p>

It is said that in times of trouble or turmoil, you can always rely on family to be there for you in your time of need, you know blood is thicker than water and all that, but this economic meltdown is putting some families to the test.<p>

In every family there may be one family member that is much better off financially than the rest, who is often counted on to help out a needy family member with a loan, or assistance of some kind. It is wonderful to have a close knit family that you can count on in troubled waters right? Not if you’re the one the family always comes to for assistance in paying their debts.
<p>

If you’re the one who has been prudent and practiced good debt management in your family and are constantly being asked to help out one family member or another with their reducing debt problems, the time may have come for you to learn to say NO. <p>

That may sound harsh, but consistently bailing your loved ones out of debt isn’t necessarily healthy for them or you. Loved ones that continuously struggle with debt management are in need of more than your cash, they need a good credit counselor to help them to manage their debt properly and live within their means. Practicing good debt management is a healthy sign of growth and independence and something we all must achieve not just some of the chosen few.<p>

Managing your money wisely is a sign of emotional maturity and stability, and while receiving money from a relative to pay your debt may seem like the easy solution, in the long run is the worst thing you can do for your own personal growth.<p>
	 
On the flip side being the “more fortunate one” that family and friends come to for debt assistance can be very detrimental not only to your bank account, but your health and well being. Feeling as if you are the family bank can instill feelings of anger, resentment, and hurt feelings from the feeling of being used for your money, all of which can be very bad for your physical and mental states.
<p>
	
The best gift you can give yourself and a needy family member is the phone number for a reputable credit counselor that can help your loved one back to reducing debt and living within their budget. <p>

<strong>SEEING RED CAN KEEP YOU FROM SEEING PINK</strong><p>
	
In today’s economy while we are all trying hard to practice better debt management and worrying about holding on to our jobs with the rising unemployment, any new information is useful, right! A new study published February 5, 2009 in Science magazine on line, stated that the color red can make employees work more accurately, while blue can enhance those same employees to be more creative.<p>
	
Researchers at the University of British Columbia conducted studies of 600 test subjects in order to assess how cognitive performance fluctuates when test subjects were exposed to the colors of red and blue. The study examined participants who performed tasks, where in words or images were displayed against red, blue, or neutral backgrounds on computer screens, and what result it had on their cognitive abilities. <p>
	
It was found that the red test group had better recall and attention to detail, such as remembering words or spelling and punctuation. While the blue group were more adept at tasks involving invention and creation, and using their imagination.
Researchers have been studying the effects color has on people in many different venues, from a performance perspective to emotional responses and perception. In the cognitive sense colors are said to affect us by the mood they transmit, and therefore may induce as well.<p>
	
In essence what they are saying is that if your job is one that requires attention to detail or that you are in a supervisory position you may want to change your computer screen to a red screen saver or incorporate more red in your wardrobe.
On the other hand, if you work in a field that requires you to be creative such as advertising or the like you will want to surround yourself with blue, it produces feelings of happiness and happier people are more likely to be imaginative and creative and less analytical.
<p>
	
In today’s environment of struggling daily with reducing debt, job security, rising unemployment, and the never ending battle of trying to save money, while trying to hold on to your job, phew… we can all use some helpful tips. 
So, if you’re an accountant trying to stay focused on how to rein in your company’s bad debt management habits and balance the budget, go red, red, and redder.<p>
	
However, if you’re the creative director for an advertising agency trying to come up with a new PR campaign you need to stop worrying about your company’s bad debt management practices and where they may need to save money and start surrounding yourself in blue, blue and more blue before your boss really does make you blue with a pink slip!<p>
	

   <strong>CELL PHONE DEBT CUTTING YOU SHORT AND HAVE YOU SEEING RED
        FIVE CONSUMER ADVOCATE TIPS TO HELP SAVE YOUR MONEY</strong>
        <p>
	
In this economy we are all trying to save money and reducing debt, but there are certain expenses we can’t live with out and for most people that includes our cell phones. A report by consumer advocates groups’ states that one of the most often complained about consumer services are cell phone fees and the hidden contract fine print. 
So in an effort to help consumers save money we have compiled five tips from the experts to hopefully assist you in saving yourself from aggravation and some money to boot.
      <p>
1.  Cell phone providers (most) require consumers to sign a date specific contract,
      yet when a consumer tries to replace a stolen or damaged cell phone they are
      required to restart the contract all over again. As an alternative to this we     
      suggest removing the SIM card from the broken phone and buying an 
      inexpensive phone to put it into and don’t bother to report it to the cell phone
      provider.<p>
2.   As in #1 when dealing with teens and preteens which are the most common 
      of those who lose or damage their cell phones, buy them prepaid phones and                                 
      you have no worries about contracts or pricey replacement costs.<p>
3.	Text messaging fees are on the rise investigate unlimited plans both for 
       texting and calling they do exist and will save you lots of money.<p>
4.	 If you want to stay with your provider but are always over your minute 
       capacity there is a free consumer service that will alert you by email or text 
       message when you are reaching your limit; go to www.overmyminutes.com<p>
5.	Read and understand the terms and conditions of your fine print contract, due
      to a growing number of complaints, lawsuits and pressure from legislators the
      bigger cell phone providers have revised their penalty of $150.00 to $200.00 
      for terminating a contract to a prorated basis so read your contract carefully.<p>

We hope you will find these tips helpful, we know how hard it is to make ends meet these days and these money saving tips sure can help.

Hence, it is always a good idea to reduce debt as soon as possible so that you don’t sink. But is there a way of reducing debt?</p> 
<p>There are several solutions for reducing your debt but the solutions depend on your situation. If you are already very deep in debt then what you really need is a debt consolidation loan, which will take care of all your debts. But if you are not too deep in debt and your finances are still intact then here are three ways for reducing debts:</p>
<p>Reduce your spend: You need to work out your weekly or monthly spends in such a way that you are able to save extra money, which can be used for paying off the next months phone bills or insurance premiums. Make a list of regular expenditures and miscellaneous expenditures. Most people spend on food on a daily basis and this is one place where you can’t cut corners. But you can definitely save money by not spending on things that you can do without like expensive perfumes or fine dining etc. Creating a personal budget like this will have a major affect on your outlook of your finances.</p>
<p>Increase your income: Look for different avenues or ways to increase you income. Today, the Internet offers several opportunities to earn money from the convenience of your home. Some options like affiliate marketing etc can be a potential money earner.</p>

<p>So there are many ways one can get rid of their debt. Reducing debt is important for maintaining good financial health.</p>
