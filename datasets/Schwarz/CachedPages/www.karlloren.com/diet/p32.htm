        <h1>The Atkins Diet:<br> A Brief Overview</h1>
        <br clear="all">
        <p><b>What is The Atkins Diet?</b>
        <p>&nbsp;
        <ol>
          <li>A lifetime nutritional philosophy, focusing on the consumption of
            nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods and vita-nutrient supplementation.
            The Atkins diet restricts processed/refined carbohydrates (which
            make up over 50% of many people's diets), such as high-sugar foods,
            breads, pasta, cereal, and starchy vegetables. Core vita-nutrient
            supplementation includes a full-spectrum multi-vitamin and an
            essential oils/fatty acid formula.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>A lifetime nutritional philosophy that has been embraced by an
            estimated 20+ million people worldwide since the release of <i>Dr.
            Atkins' Diet Revolution</i> in the 1970s.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>The cornerstone of the treatment protocols for over 60,000
            patients of The Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York
            City.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>The Major Benefits of the Diet, In Short</b>
        <p>Diets high in sugar and refined carbohydrates like bread, pasta,
        cereal, and other mainly &quot;low-fat&quot; processed foods increase
        your body's production of insulin. When insulin is at high levels in the
        body, the food you eat can get readily converted into body fat, in the
        form of triglycerides (to top it off, high triglyceride levels in the
        body are one of the greatest risk factors for heart disease).
        <p>Even worse, high carbohydrate meals tend to leave you less satisfied
        than those that contain adequate fat levels; so you eat more and get
        hungrier sooner. If you find this hard to believe, think about how much
        pasta you can eat at lunch and then how hungry you are running to the
        vending machine for another &quot;carbo-fix&quot; in the mid-afternoon.
        If the pasta you ate was really giving your body what it needed, you
        would stay full until dinner time. So the typical low-protein, low-fat
        meal leaves you eating more and hungry sooner.
        <p>So what should you do? Get off the insulin generating roller coaster
        of the low-fat diet and start cutting down on your carbohydrate
        consumption, especially the worst offenders: sugar, white flour and
        other refined carbohydrate-based products. What can you expect from
        this? Three wonderful results:<br>
        <p>&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li><b>You'll start to burn fat for energy:</b> Since carbohydrates
            are the body's primary energy source, you'll rarely use your
            secondary energy source, you own body fat, for energy unless you
            restrict carbohydrate consumption. This offers a lifetime of body
            fat burning, which is the goal of most people trying to lose weight.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>You won't feel hungry in between meals:</b> The biggest battle
            that most people have with weight loss is the constant obsession
            with food (for example, if you've ever thought about dinner when
            you're eating lunch). Again, much of this is caused by blood sugar
            fluctuations that are aggravated by carbohydrate consumption
            (especially the refined kind). By cutting the carbs, you'll maintain
            a more even blood sugar level throughout the day. No more false
            hunger pains or mid-afternoon brain drains.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>Your overall health will improve and you'll feel better:</b>
            Many of the toxins you take into your body are stored in your fat
            cells. By getting your body to burn stored fat, you allow it to
            clean itself out. Combined with the benefits of stable blood sugar,
            the end result is that many common ailments you have been
            experiencing could well be alleviated. Fatigue, irritability,
            depression, headaches, and even many forms of joint and muscular
            pain simply go away. Furthermore, you should see a significant
            improvement in your blood profile, (including cholesterol and blood
            pressure levels). All this leads to better health and well-being--
            something all of us strive to bring into our lives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Key Information About Sugar</b>
        <p>It contains no vitamins. No minerals. It is 100% carbohydrate. So it
        must be metabolized immediately. The stores of nutrients built up in
        your body are called out like militia men, to &quot;charge&quot; the
        sugar, and similar forms like glucose and fructose, and turn it into
        ready energy, depleting your body in the process. Sugar is an energy
        sucker: the Anti-Nutrient.
        <p>White flour is its second-cousin&#x2014;almost as bad. When you partner
        the two together&#x2014; flour and sugar&#x2014;it spells disaster for anyone
        trying to maintain a healthy body, let alone someone who is fighting
        disease or trying to lose weight. If they are consumed on a regular
        basis, the body is in a constant state of nutritional deficiency. If you
        don't believe that sugar is an anti-nutrient, try having a rich dessert
        after dinner on a night you're feeling under the weather &#x2013; you'll be
        sure to wake up the next morning with a full-blown illness.
        <p>What's frightening is that in recent years, the government and other
        advisory groups like the American Medical Association have encouraged
        the consumption of flour by unveiling a new food pyramid that is based
        on grains and recommends six to eleven servings a day. And no
        distinction is made between white processed flour, which is stripped of
        the nutrients, especially important trace minerals, and the much more
        healthy whole grains (unless you have a food allergy). And the result?
        Americans now think they're making healthy choices by loading up on
        cereals, pasta, crackers and breads. We even have products like
        Pop-Tarts&#xAE;, with 39 grams of carbohydrate, 20 of which are sugar,
        carrying the American Heart Association Seal Of Approval. It is a
        travesty.
        <p>So how do we protect ourselves and stay healthy? One thing we can do
        is eat a healthy, balanced diet of low-carbohydrate foods. And when our
        foods fail us, as they often do after being picked, shipped, stripped,
        processed and packaged, we can protect ourselves with solid
        vita-nutrient support. It is critical that you include this extra
        &quot;insurance policy&quot; to take you into the kind of healthy life
        we all want to lead.

        <p><b>Answering The Critics</b>
        <p>While mainstream medicine and nutrition have, on the whole,
        criticized the Atkins Diet, the facts speak for themselves:
        <p>&nbsp;
        <ol>
          <li>Dr. Atkins and his colleagues at The Atkins Center for
            Complementary Medicine in New York have treated over 60,000 patients
            using the Atkins Diet as a primary protocol. These patients
            experience all the beneficial effects detailed above, as well as
            improved blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and a lower or
            completely eradicated dependence on prescription drugs.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>While the mainstream critics continue to lament the consumption of
            fat as the root of America's weight problem, only carbohydrate
            consumption (mostly refined) has increased in the past few decades,
            while fat consumption has declined (as the &quot;low-fat/high carb&quot;
            diet has been promoted as the best nutritional option for every
            living person). During this time:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Obesity, which in the past had consistently applied to about
                25% of the population,increased to 33%
              <li>Heart disease now accounts for 50% of all deaths, up from 40%
                in the 1970s
              <li>Cases of diabetes are growing in near epidemic proportions (in
                fact, children are now contracting adult-onset diabetes)
              <li>Hypertension, chronic fatigue and attention-deficit-disorder
                are now well recognized conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these conditions are linked not by the amount of fat in
            ones diet, but by blood sugar disturbances and insulin disorders
            caused by excessive refined carbohydrate consumption (FYI: The
            average person now consumes over 150 pounds of sugar a year, up from
            less then 10 pounds in the 19th century).
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>While medical and nutritional journals are filled with studies
            documenting the body's requirement of essential fatty acids and
            essential amino acids (derived from protein), there is no such thing
            as an essential carbohydrate. Why then does the FDA recommend an
            average of 16 servings a day?
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>The Atkins Diet is not a no-carbohydrate diet. The diet focuses on
            very limited consumption of the types of carbohydrates that tend to
            spike blood sugar levels the most, including non-whole grain bread,
            pastas, refined sugar products, juices, and high sugar/starchy
            fruits and vegetables. Atkins Dieters learn to determine their
            personal sensitivity to carbohydrates, as a way to manage their
            weight and health for life.</li>
        </ol>

        Philosophy (such as the Atkins Diet):</b>

        The Wednesday Letter is a free electronic monthly newsletter written and published by Karl Loren.&nbsp; 
        You can view more than 50 back issues of this publication by <a href="http://www.oralchelation.com/wednesday/index.html">clicking here</a>.&nbsp; 
        The Wednesday Letter subscription list is maintained on a secure server, no name is ever given or sold to anyone, and it is never used except for this Newsletter.&nbsp; 
        It is automatically published on the Tuesday night just before the first Wednesday of every month.&nbsp; 
        You can subscribe to this free monthly electronic letter by entering your eMail address and name below.&nbsp; 
        You will then automatically receive a request for confirmation, sent to whatever address you have entered.&nbsp; 
        If you do NOT receive this confirmation request, then you will not be subscribed.&nbsp; 
        There may have been an error with your address and you should resubmit.&nbsp; 
        The letter is never sent twice to the same address -- so you do not have to worry about a duplicate subscription.&nbsp;
        When you receive this confirmation request you must reply to it, or your subscription will not become active.&nbsp; 
        No one can subscribe your name, and address, without you being notified, and if you get an unwanted notice of subscription you only need to DO NOTHING and the subscription will NOT be active.

        You can remove yourself from the subscription list in several different ways.&nbsp; 
        <a href="http://www.oralchelation.com/wednesday/index.html">Click here</a> to read about this entire newsletter system.&nbsp; 
        Every edition of The Wednesday Letter is delivered to your address with YOUR name and address in view on the letter, with a link that allows you to remove THAT name from the subscription list.&nbsp; 
        If you try to send this removal message from an address different from the one you used to send in your original confirmation, then you will get a warning notice first, sent to the subscription address, asking you to confirm that you want to be removed from the list -- by replying to THAT request for confirmation, you will then be automatically removed.&nbsp; 
        Thus, no one else can unsubscribe you, from some other computer, without your knowledge.&nbsp; 
        But, if you send in the unsubscribe notice from the same machine used to receive the Letter, then the removal from the subscription list is automatic.
