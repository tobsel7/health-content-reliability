      <p>To answer the question, here's a short biography on: &quot;Who is Tony Horton?&quot;</p>
      <p>Raised in the small Rhode Island town of Westerly, Tony
        preferred fast food to his mother's healthy home cooking.</p>
      <p>As a kid, he hated exercising, and didn't particularly like sports.</p>
      <p>He describes himself as the &quot;quintessential
        98-pound weakling,&quot; and had all of the insecurities that went along with it.</p>
      <h2>Onward to Hollywood</h2>
      <p>After graduating from the University of Rhode Island, Tony moved to Hollywood to pursue his dreams of becoming
        an actor. He found himself working long hours, which didn't leave time to exercise or eat right-or so he
        told himself.</p>
      <p>Although his ambition was high, his physical health was at an all time low. With some urging
        from his talent agent, Tony realized that to make it in showbiz, he needed to get fit.</p>
      <h2><img src="http://www.healthynewage.com/images/picture-tony-horton-1.jpg" alt="Tony Horton Fitness Biography" width="125" height="200" class="float-left-thin-border" />But Guys Like Arnold Were <em>Too</em> Big</h2>
      <p>From that point on, Tony says his life changed forever. He joined the World Gym in Venice, California, where Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferigno worked out. He watched them and asked questions and read every book
        he could get his hands on.</p>
      <p>But Tony didn't like the bulky, stiff, body-builder look, so he focused on exercises for speed, flexibility
        and balance that would give him a more streamlined appearance. He learned cardiovascular training, from world-class
        triathlete, Mark Sission, who introduced him to exhilaration drills and interval training.</p>

      <h2>Looking Good</h2>
      <p>As Tony got in better shape, he noticed that other things in his life were shaping up too. He felt better,
        his brain was sharper and he was more productive in everyday life.</p>
      <p>Tony had hit his stride and his world
        opened up. He started...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>rock-climbing</li>
        <li>inline skating</li>
        <li>doing yoga (laying the groundwork for <em>P90X Yoga</em>)</li>
        <li>practicing Pilates</li>
        <li>utilizing plyometrics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The more he learned,
        the better he looked and felt.</p>
      <p>Friends and acquaintances were blown away by his physical transformation and started asking him how he did
        it. Before long, word got around: whatever <strong>Tony Horton</strong>, trainer, was doing, he was doing right! Word soon
        got to musician Tom Petty.</p>
      <h2>Tony Horton: Fitness Trainer to the Stars</h2>
      <p>Tony helped Tom get in the best shape in his life, and then went on to train some of his rock-n-roll friends.
        This began Tony's career as a sought after fitness trainer.</p>
      <p><img src="http://www.healthynewage.com/images/picture-tony-horton-2.jpg" alt="P90X Tony Horton" width="187" height="237" class="float-left-thin-border" />Over the years, he built his training career, establishing ASH Fitness in Santa Monica.</p>
      <p>His acclaimed exercise
        techniques appeared in Men's Fitness Magazine and Tony established an on-camera presence as the spokesperson
        for Nordic Track.</p>
      <p>Then, in the late 90's, he was retained by a major Hollywood studio to condition the
        entire cast of the motion picture The 13th Warrior.</p>
      <h2>Resistance Bands</h2>
      <p>In 1996, Tony met Beach Body president, Carl Daikeler through one of his clients. Tony and Carl hit it off
        immediately and soon became friends. Before long, Carl hired Tony to be his personal trainer.</p>
      <p>After three
        months of Tony' s instruction, Carl was in absolute disbelief. In just 90 days, he saw changes in his body,
        he never thought possible. Carl knew Tony had hit upon something truly revolutionary...</p>

      <p><strong>Power Your Way with P90X Fitness Program</strong> by Carol Bardelli</p>
      <p>All workouts are not created equal. The Tony Horton P90x workout routine stands apart. I achieved results that took me to a new level of fitness.</p>
      <p>I discovered P90X exercise program after giving birth at age 40. I had gained 25 pounds and struggled to lose it. The program changed my body in ways classic weight training and aerobics hadn't. In the first 90 days I lost inches and fat, and gained muscle.</p>
      <p>The difference is personal trainer Tony Horton's approach. He incorporates aerobics and resistance training and he does it with humor. This combination whipped me into the best shape I'd ever been in.</p>
      <p>All three <em>Tony Horton Power 90</em> boot camp systems require only dumbbells or a resistance band. They're designed to get anyone fitter fast. In 90 days your body will change whether you're a man or a woman.</p>
      <p>There's a Power 90 system for all levels of fitness. The workouts accommodate beginners and intermediate exercisers with 30-minute workouts.</p>
      <p>When I was ready to take it to the next level, Power 90X offered twelve exercise DVDs that guaranteed even more incredible results. Power 90X Plus (<strong>P90X Plus</strong>) features five new extreme workouts that challenge me to even greater fitness.</p>
      <p>All three systems include a nutrition plan to support achieving the lean body I wanted. The <strong>P90X Nutrition Plan</strong> &quot;Fat Shredder&quot; phase got me to 17 percent body fat—within the elite athlete range for women. And I'm 48 years old now. I'm never hungry and enjoy a flexible menu. I even eat out at restaurants and many convenience foods are not off limits.</p>
      <p>Power 90 systems allowed me to eat more than other weight loss programs. I fueled my workouts with delicious and satisfying foods. Eating the Power 90 way has given me the body I want and the life I deserve.</p>
      <p>If you're ready to transform physically and mentally, there's a Power 90 system for you. Are you ready to lose body fat and get lean? Take the challenge. I guarantee you'll love the results as much as I do.</p>

      <h2><a name="tenminutetrainerreview" id="10minutetrainerreview"></a>Tony Horton 10 Minute Trainer Review</h2>
      <p><strong>Get Fit Fast</strong></p>
      <p>We've all been there. We need to workout but we're short on time and bored with the same old workouts. Another long stint on the treadmill or wrestling with weights is too much to face. So we throw in the towel and skip it.</p>
      <p>I'm a wife, mother, and work full time. My schedule is hectic even on weekends. Sometimes I don't have half an hour to workout, let alone tackle aerobics and resistance training.</p>
      <p>Well, those days are over. I've discovered a training system that changes your body and takes only ten minutes a day. Unbelievable, you say? Then it's time to check out the Tony Horton 10 Minute Trainer.  You'll become a believer.</p>
      <p>I've been using this system since its release and love the results I'm achieving. Tony Horton's Super Stacking Technique&trade; is a cutting edge solution and guides you through innovative workout moves that tone muscles and work you aerobically at the same time.</p>
      <p>These workouts aren't just fast, they're fun.  It's no secret why celebrities and CEOs want him by their sides. His techniques will get you ripped and he'll keep you smiling. His approach makes everyone look forward to exercising.</p>
      <p>The <em>Tony Horton 10 Minute workout</em> includes eight different workouts in two DVDs. You can work your whole body with Total Body or Total Body 2. You can also target specific body parts with Lower Body, Abs, Cardio, Core Cardio, and Upper Body.</p>
      <p>My favorite 10 Minute Trainer workout is Yoga Flex. I've tried dozens of different yoga workouts and this is the most creative and enjoyable yoga workout I've come across. This total body stretch centers your body, mind, and spirit in just ten minutes.</p>
      <p>10 Minute Trainer saves time, relieves stress, and gets you a great body.</p>

      <p><strong>Beyond Extreme</strong></p>
      <p>Tony Horton is The Godfather of extreme workouts. With workout systems under his belt like Power 90X and Power Half Hour, he's a master of pushing exercisers to new heights.</p>
      <p>His latest workout system is Tony Horton One On One. Don't let the cozy title fool you. These are not your drill sergeant's boot camp workouts. We're talking killer training. This system's catch phase says it all. &quot;No set, no cast, no mercy!&quot;</p>
      <p>Beachbody™ describes these workouts as &quot;non-stop heart pumping action.&quot; Believe it. You're welcomed inside Tony's private home gym with a war cry and each grinding routine takes you right to the edge of exhaustion.</p>
      <p>I own over 500 exercise videos and I've never seen cinematography this cutting edge. A handheld camera captures the action from novel angles and gives these workouts an edgy realism. Most exercise videos are shot with a stationary camera panning smoothly from frame to frame. These videos break the rules, are eye grabbing and put you inside the action.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Disc One:</em> <strong>Plyo Legs</strong> incorporates jumping, and Tony keeps you airborne. Designed to produce fast, powerful movements, plyometrics training works your legs with intensity and precision.</li>
        <li><em>Disc Two:</em> <strong>Road Warrior</strong> never takes you on the road. There's no need to leave Tony's gym. The end of the trail of this workout leaves you too maxed out to crawl.</li>
        <li><em>Disc Three:</em> <strong>Killer Abs</strong> features classic abdominal work, but leave it to Tony to incorporate radical new moves to push you to the next level. Six pack abs are guaranteed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Tony Horton's One On One workouts are an ongoing production project. A new DVD is delivered to subscribers every month. It's like Christmas morning when that package arrives and you open a new state-of-the-art extreme workout.</p>

  <p>I find nowadays fitness routines or people going around wasting time and energy to exercise to get themselves looking better or feeling better about themselves is a pile of rubbish. Come on. I never lift a weight or join exercise classes in my life and you want to know something: I have still a clean bill of health and nothing wrong with me. And so many others could think that way if they live their life the way they want it. 
As soon as they see people in shape on TV saying "you could look like this and feel like this, all of sudden they just want it. Basically, you just brainwash people's minds thinking they need it. It's all about the buck and there is no careful feedback on what you reflect or give out. And if I sound negative about the whole thing, well just go ahead bitch me out then. But I will laugh at you guys more and more!</p>

  <p>I am interested in doing P90X with my wife as she wants to lose weight and it seems like a good workout program. I am 33, 6'1", 176 lbs, thin, but not cut up like I used to be. I train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts and was wondering if doing P90X will hurt my training because I will be too tired? Thanks, Robert</p>

  <p>Robert - My husband and I are doing P90X and love it! You'll probably be able to incorporate your training into the P90X program, so I wouldn't be too worried about tiring out. There are actually 3 different routines to choose from, so you can choose the one you think will work best for you. I am doing the lean routine, while my husband is doing the classic. I like to distance run, and have kept that up while doing this program. Good luck!</p>

  <p>I received the P90X program July 9th 2007. I started seeing and feeling the results just after 1 week. I work in sales and always need to look my best and be sharp. I actually wish that I could make money selling this. I have been telling everyone that knows me about what I have found. I can't wait to take my 30 day pictures. I feel more alive, and my mind hasn't been this sharp in years. My wife is also so surprised on how flexible I have become so quickly. I have a smith machine in the garage and have gotten more out of P90X in 23 days than I have gotten out of my bench in 1 year. Tony is the man and really brings the fun to this program. Lastly the most exciting part about P90X is that it's not a program where you will get bored and just get short term results, this has become a part of my lifestyle. To all of you reading this....order it and "BRING IT"!!</p>

  <p>Aristotle said, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but a habit." The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.  In order to achieve an extraordinary of level of fitness we need to strive for extraordinary exercises, which challenges us to step out of our level of comfort.  I have incorporated several of the exercises provided in P90X with my clients and have tweaked many in order to provide incredible results.  Champions are those who remain courageous in the presence of ridicule.  All the best, Tony.</p>

  <p>I am planning to start p90x in January 2008. I'm currently doing Power90. I want to know more about the three levels. The infomercials did not refer to 3 levels. I am worried about being able to "Bring It" and don't want to waste my money if I can't do it. Thanks.

  <p>I am starting my 5th week or 2nd phase of P90X now, and I am a firm believer in it. I used to go to the gym and workout for 1 1/2 hrs everyday. I thought 4 sets of 6 reps on the bench press was "working out". Boy, was I ever surprised when I started P90X, and I couldn't even finish some of the workouts let alone keep up with Tony and his crew. After 5 weeks I am down 13 lbs and have doubled my pull up reps. Each workout,even the weight workouts,are done at a pace that brings cardiovascular work into the mix. Which provides results very quickly. If you're thinking about P90X, I suggest you do it. You will not be disappointed. Trust me.

  <p>My wife and I are into our second week of this and wow! It is definitely a great workout. We love how Tony coaches through the program and lets you know it is OK if you are not able to keep up with them. We are going at our own pace but we are bringing it every time. One day we will be able to keep up the pace. After trying different workout plans in the past and not seeing results, I know we will with P90X. Thanks!

  <p>I am in my 5th week and definitely loving the program. A unique and great aspect of this workout program is that you can take it on the road. I go to a lot of conferences through work, and frankly there are few windows when I'm home for 90 days at a stretch. With that said, I bring the DVD's, resistance bands and my portable DVD player with me on the road and am able to get in great workouts on the road. Admittedly, not having the pull up bar can be a drag, but the resistance bands are adequate substitutes in a pinch.</p>

  <p>My wife Michelle and I are 43. We are on our 11th week for the second time this year. Our first time was from January to March last spring. We are both  in the best shape of our lives and loving it. I have recommended this program to many of my friends.  Like the program suggests, just press play, and the results happen. We are off to Cancun next week. "Do your best and forget the rest." And "You can do anything for 30 seconds." These have become words we truly believe in.</p>

  <p>There are always going to be critics that feel insecure and have to cut down others to feel better about themselves, oh well who cares, they're negative because they've never tested themselves and that is too bad. Anyway not going to rent space in my brain worrying about what they think. I am 42, and just finished the P90X routine, and I am happy to say I like, no love, the results. I haven't been in this great of shape or looked this good since I was a 22 year old Marine. I would recommend this and only this workout to anyone who is serious about changing their bodies. I have tried many different workouts in my life, but this is the only one I would stand by. The constant muscle confusion, consistency and diet are the keys. By Summer 2008 I'll be 43, have 16" guns, and a six pack, 25 years after I graduated High School.</p>

I am 15 years old. I am in week five and the results were amazing. I was a little bit overweight and now  I can see my 6 pack starting to show. I also do in addition to P90X, thirty minutes on the treadmill and another 15 on the cross trainer elliptical machine every day. this has actually made the results much faster. </p>

  <p>I started P90X on Feb 21st, 2008, so I am now in Phase 3 week 2 of P90X Classic. I'm 43 and I have dropped from 230 lbs to 197 lbs. I feel better than I've ever felt, and I've never looked better. I don't think I've ever taken off my shirt at the beach in the last 10-15 years. If I can give one small bit of advice. Yes, this program is grueling if you are not in shape to start with, so only do what you can do. Don't try to keep up with Tony. Do understand what each exercise is designed to do and take each one at your own pace. You'll get there and despite all the naysayers out there, P90X works.</p>

  <p>This comment is directed to Steve. Your an idiot to say that there is no link to exercise and health. Look at the science out there and you will find plenty of info. I have both a masters and bachelor's degree in Exercise Science. I have been a full time trainer for 10 years now since graduate school. I think there are a lot of b.s. fitness gimmicks out there. However, the P90X/P90 programs are in my opinion, the best out there. I have a similar approach to training my clients as well. Muscle confusion, variation, etc. Just everyone do use the tools this guy give you at you own pace and be smart about some of the exercises if you have any limitations. There are easily over 100 health benefits related to exercise. If you don't believe them I will talk to you in about 10 years when your in a wheel chair STEVE.</p>

  <p>Glad to see so many P90X successes speaking up.  At 38 I've remained rock solid for the past 3 years after losing 70 lbs with Tony's Power 90 & P90X. To those who question whether or not they can keep up with the X, consider where you're starting. If you're generally in decent shape or are doing a less intense routine now, go for it.  It will push you further than you've been pushed before and you'll love it. If you're way out of shape, like I was, start with something else and build up. If you can't "bring it" for a full 50 minutes at first, just make you're way through with the best you can do. After a few weeks when you find yourself able to somewhat keep up with your on screen gym mates, you'll know it's working. After a few years, you'll be daring them to keep up. It's the real deal and I am forever thankful. Thanks again Hortonhead, from the Pepper.</p>

  <p>I've just started my third month of p90X. I'm loving it and the results it is bringing. I'm the fittest and strongest I have ever been. Not bad for a 41 year old that was feeling so old and unfit a year ago that I decided to change my ways. If you are already on a fitness program and working out you will be able to do p90X, well most of it. I am only now, after a couple of months, able to keep up with the crew. Six times a week is a huge commitment for me, but it's easy to keep going when you see results.</p>

  <p>I've just started the P90X routines and am loving it. It's a lot of fun and unbelievably varied. I don't see myself getting bored by 'routine' any time soon. Biggest downside is just the difficulty level. There are some exercises and stretches that are simply way out of my league at the moment. But even that's not a big problem. I just make note of them and move on and work towards being able to do them. I especially enjoy the way Tony runs the exercises and often mentions taking a pause, going at your own pace, etc.</p>

  <p>On day 3 of week 3 of P90X. I'm pleased with my energy level and with some of the tightness I'm feeling in my core section. I do the workouts daily, I drink the after-workout drink which I really like. I enjoy the nutrition bars in place of a meal every once in a while, but I'm not really shedding the pounds. I'm not following the diet plan and that might be the problem. I struggle with this part because I have 3 kids at home and I'm always on the run. I'm 44 year old mom and my metabolism has just slowed down so much this last year it seems. I need some encouragement here on the loosing weight part.  Maybe some of you experienced this in the early stages of the program and can share some advice or support.</p>

  <p>I just started the P90X program. The workout is as advertised "extreme." But it is not for rookies, don't expect to be able to complete the routines or keep up with Tony and his people on the DVDs. The P90X yoga routine is 90 minutes. First try I made it through 60 minutes while doing many of the poses badly. But it is still a great work out. I have found the bands difficult to use so far. I wish they showed more techniques on them.

  <p>I love P90X and the follow-up program P90X+. I can't believe how these workouts have transformed my body. I have lost 30 lbs and over 30" with these programs. When I started, I never thought I would be able to do a program labeled "Extreme", but I tried it anyway. And now I continue to do my best and "Bring It" everyday. This program is about working out 6 days a week and eating clean. P90X comes with a step by step guides for the workout and nutrition part of the program to help you through each of step of the program.

For those afraid to try a program because they saw it on TV do not know what they are missing.  I see success story after success story. I believe this program works better then going to a gym where many people end up walking around going now what do I do? I am an independent Beachbody coach.</p>

It's a matter of balancing your caloric intake to make sure you are putting in enough calories, properly balanced between proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

  <p>I have just finished up day 4 of the first phase of P90X. I will tell you that I'm a 45 year old female, who's run 6 marathons, and worked out with weights for the past 7 years. I watched the commercials with great interest, because now that the last child has started kindergarten, I wanted to get back in the best shape of my life, and not just be in a maintenance mode. I thought with my fitness level, I would have a pretty easy time of it, but I must tell you that these workouts are just killer. I absolutely love it that I'm pushed to the limit on everything, and am completely whipped when I finish. I'm using muscles that haven't been worked out at all with my previous workouts, and I couldn't be happier already. My weight is where it should be, so I'm looking to become rock solid and in fantastic shape, and then to maintain this for life. I have always wanted the real muscles, but didn't like the body builder look, and complete fitness is what I'm looking for. I am so happy with this program already, and am excited to do my workout every day. I can't wait to see what I'll look like at the end of the 90 days. I'll hopefully be looking for the P90X plus, and will definitely want a tank top to advertise P90X.</p>

  <p>Hi Robert, please look into suspension swimming. You can go into a harness that is suspended over a pool and move your body through the water to regain some of your movement and burn some calories. They have these at many of the local YMCA's. Please check into it. You can get a membership based on your income.</p>

  <p>Hi Ed, Diabetes does complicate things a bit but if you eat just an hour or so before working out you should have enough glucose in your system to have a great workout and not need to depend on candy to bring your level back up again. If you take and eat a small amount of fruit after the workout it should help. The fiber in the fruit will allow it to go into the system a bit slower than having a harsh jolt from the candy.</p>

  <p>I need to drop 10-15lbs, I've seen the commercials and was wondering what if you can't get a pull-up bar installed in your home, then what? Understand keep your own pace, how strict is the diet? Is it reasonable? Just want some information from people who have gone through it. Do you work out 7 days a week?</p>

  <p>I am on week 7 of p90x, the workouts are very challenging even to someone such as myself who is used to heavy push up routines. The first chest back and shoulder routine floored me, very difficult. Muscle confusion is definitely the way to go, I dropped 35lbs in 3 months and lost 3 inches off my waist. I'm in the best shape I've been in years.</p>

  <p>I am currently on my second round of P90X and have incorporated some P90X + and One on One workouts in there as well. This program is fantastic. This is the real deal, real people with real results. I started at a 37" waist in round one and ended in a 32 inch waist. That alone is enough motivation to continue with the fitness lifestyle. The variety of these workouts and the ones I have been adding in round two really make this program top notch. I am in better shape now than when I was playing baseball in college. If you are considering getting this program, just do it. It is time to reward your body and mind.</p>

  <p>I am 49 and completed p90x about 4 weeks ago. I lost over 30 lbs and went from 0 pull ups to 12, 15 push ups to over 50 and I am in the best shape of my life. I was in bad shape before my p90x experience. I fell off a roof and shattered my ankles and broke my back. I thought there was no place to turn to help. At first I was very limited to what I could do in the routines, but as time went on I was able to keep up with Tony and do every workout. To my surprise my ankles and back got better, less pain, more strength, and more flexible. Thanks to Tony and p90x I am back to the shape I was in when I was a 21 year old Marine.</p>

  <p>My fiancee and I are in our 7th week of the classic P90X. Although it is demanding, we have not had too many problems, both being fit and active most of our lives. She is an accredited trainer. I'm 50, going on 51 and enjoy working with the kids. My weight is 155. I'm 5'10" and have defined abs. Our goal is to just add more definition and tone to our current shape, no weight loss. We were wondering if anyone else felt that the program is a little extensive when it comes to the number of push ups and pull ups.  Otherwise the variety is great. Looking forward to bringing it to 90 days, and then modifying the next program for our specific needs.</p>

  <p>Hi Andy,
There’s quite a difference between Tony Horton’s 10 Minute Workout and Power 90X, although they are both based on the principles of muscle confusion. The 10 Minute Workout program is designed to fit into a busy schedule, and is more suited to beginner and intermediate fitness levels. Power 90X is an extreme in home boot camp aimed at fit people looking to take the next step to ultimate fitness.
Power 90X is designed to be used about an hour a day for six days a week. It is time consuming, but the results are truly extreme. P90X is made up of 12 workouts, including five resistance workouts, four cardio workouts, and three abdominal workouts. P90X is demanding but the results are incredible and accomplished within 90 days.
If you’re not ready for an extreme fitness system that demands a minimum of six hours a week, and up to twelve hours a week with P90X Doubles, I recommend Tony Horton’s 10 Minute Trainer. You can spend as little as 10 minutes a day for three day a week while jump starting your journey to fitness. You’re not limited to one 10 Minute Trainer workout a day either. You can stack the workouts, doing two or more, for faster results.  
If you placed an order for the wrong Beachbody workout, I’d advise calling the Beachbody customer service number, or contacting customer service through their website. They can advise you about returning an item, if necessary.  
But there’s no reason you can’t incorporate more than one workout system into your fitness repertoire. I own both Power 90X and 10 Minute Trainer and use them both. When I have an hour to spare, I use P90X. When I’m time crunched, I turn to Tony Horton’s 10 Minute Trainer to stay in shape. And the variety keeps me from getting bored. Best of luck with your goals!</p>

When he gets home from work we're going to take our "Before" pics and take measurements. After a month or two, maybe longer, we plan on getting P90X. I'm 54 and my husband is 58. I'm a new Beachbody Coach and am looking forward to helping lots of people get in shape, and get paid for it.</p>

  <p>I've had 4 kids. I'm 46yrs.5'2, and now weigh 121 lbs. from 136. But it wasn't weight that bothered me as much as not being strong anymore, or having any energy. I've gotten stronger which helps my rheumatoid arthritis. Plain and simple, this is a great program. Cut your portion size, eat slowly, clear out the junk in your cupboards, and get moving. Its really common sense but this keeps you moving, and its fun. I've also gotten great tips from the show Dr.Oz. Every little step matters. Good luck to all who use this program. Modify it if it's too much, but never quit. Make it a part of your day. Oh, and kids love to workout also. None of my kids are over weight, or ever have been. But this will keep them in shape for upcoming soccer, and give them tools that last a lifetime. Do it as a family. I highly recommend it.</p>

  <p>I am a working 33 year old mom of two boys under 4 years old. I am currently 50 pounds overweight. I have had weight problems since I was in high school. Twice I have lost this weight in the past 12 years, and now I am ready to do it yet again with a program that will work for me as a mom. Hopefully this will be the last major life change for a  while. In the past I walked and used the "step". I did have problems with plateaus, so I was very interested when I saw P90X. I have purchased that program, but have since realized I am not in shape enough to complete that program not to mention I have never been athletic or coordinated. I do have endurance and I am fairly strong. I am now considering the "10 minute" workout or the P90 program. I need to know which would be better for me. I want something that does increase my strength and flexibility. I do like the "boot camp" mentality of the other workout, and I want something with variety. I want to also incorporate walking on the treadmill as part of my routine. A major concern of mine is that the workout is something that I can do now and not fall over. Of course, I have little time, with the fact that my husband works late and I have take care of the kids in the evenings. My goal is to lose 50 pounds and get lean muscles. I am short and tend to look chunky even when I am at my ideal weight.
My first feeling is that the "10 minute" workout would be the best place to start, but I am wondering if the P90 program will work better for me in the long haul to achieve the look that I want. Please share your advice. I am on board with Tony Horton. He seems to be the "Real Deal" and it seems I will not get bored with either program.</p>

  <p>Getting up to 150lbs at age 58 was terrible. I am 5'2". All of my joints hurt and hadn't exercised in at least 20 years. That contributed to my high blood pressure. I started P90 with my husband.  After the 3 months I have lost 20lbs and can see and feel the difference. My husband has since quit. Also he gained all the weight back he had lost. I can't wait to start on P90X. Boy do I feel great and now I look so much better for my age. Thanks Tony!</p>

  <p>I just started the P90x about a 3 weeks ago. I love the work out, but it is very difficult to follow the nutritional diet, because I am in Afghanistan and it is very difficult for me to the right meals. We have a cook here and he cooks in a lot of oil and deep fried foods. I end up only eating steamed vegetables and tend to be hungry all the time. I need advice on what I can do to enjoy my meals without affecting my efforts on the program. I have tried to convince the cooks on how to cook meats, but they just won't listen.</p>

  <p>Hi Peter, first, thank you for your sacrifice and service to our country. The Power 90X nutrition plan was designed to be flexible and easy to follow. I’m sorry you’re finding it hard to follow. My main concern in your situation is you probably aren’t getting enough protein. You can’t build muscle or even repair normal daily bodily wear and tear on steamed vegetables alone. If you perform P90X on a diet of vegetables alone you will lose muscle size and strength. Whenever possible, eat a protein serving at every meal and snack. Muscle growth is dependent on dietary protein and vegetables offer only trace amounts. Healthy protein options include nuts, dairy, all meats including seafood, and protein bars and powders, if you can get a hold of some. Maybe someone stateside could ship you a supply. Protein powder mixes with most beverages including water, and soft foods like cottage cheese and pudding. Don’t be afraid of oil and other fats in small amounts. Your body needs fats to be healthy. Our brains are seventy percent fat and don’t function properly on very low fat diets. Our sex hormones and cells are also fat dependent. If a cook uses excessive amounts of oil, wipe off as much as possible. This goes for breaded foods, also. Simply scrap off the breading and eat the meat. Hunger is the enemy of any diet. And protein is the most satiating macro-nutrient. Avoid hunger by eating smalls meals that include protein, fats, and unrefined carbohydrates if desired, here’s where the vegetables come in. Try to eat every three to five hours to stave off hunger. Carbohydrates fuel your workouts, so it’s best to eat your starchier carbohydrates like oatmeal or rice before a workout. If you have to eat heavy fried foods or excessively fatty foods from time to time just watch your portions. Controlling your portions will allow you to nourish your body and still keep calories under control. Best of luck with your goals!</p>

  <p>Hello, I am a twenty-four year old man. Two years back I went to the gym. For some personal reasons I quit. Now I have become so fat that I started P90x three days ago. The thing is I am doing exercise for the first time in two years and after completing the first session the following day I was feeling a lot of pain in my triceps. I can't even lift my arm. Then I started abdominal exercises and now I feel pain on my thigh. What should I do? Should I stop the exercise for a while to get rid of this pain, or should I continue this exercise so that the pain goes away immediately? I want to continue P90x. Please give me a suggestion, thanks.</p>

  <p>Hi Rono, it sounds like you’re over training. If the pain persists beyond a few days see your physician. But if the soreness is temporary, the simple solution is advice commonly given to all people beginning a new exercise program. Start slow and do not overdue it. Minor muscle soreness is a part of strength training. But excessive soreness as you describe is a product of over training. Choosing Power 90X as a way to reintroduce an unconditioned body to exercise is not advisable unless you modify the workouts. If you’re out of shape, you can’t expect to train at an intermediate or advanced level. And Power 90X was originally designed to take already fit bodies to the next level. You can put Power 90X on the shelf for now and use a program like Tony Horton’s 10 Minute Trainer, or the original and less strenuous Power 90, to get yourself into better condition. Then you can return to Power 90X when you’re ready for the next level. Or you can stick it out with Power 90X and do less of it The X does stand for Extreme. Instead of doing five or ten sets of each exercise, do two or three sets. Give your body time to adapt and grow stronger. Don’t force it to perform at a level it’s not in condition to handle or you risk injury. And remember proper nutrition is half the battle. Follow the Power 90X nutrition guide to achieve your best results. Good luck with your fitness goals.</p>
