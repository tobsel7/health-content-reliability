<LI>&nbsp;Children with autism have language delays or other communication problems, poor or limited social skills and engage in repetitive behaviors.&nbsp;Autism refers to a wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from severe to mild.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>&nbsp;Once considered a rare disorder, today autism affects as many as 1 in every 166 children; nearly every 20 minutes a new case of autism is diagnosed.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>&nbsp;Although some early warning signs of autism appear in the first year of life and it can be detected as early as 18 months of age, the diagnosis of autism is typically not made until 3-4 years of age or later.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>&nbsp;Research has shown that early identification and intervention can make the critical difference for children with autism.<BR>If you suspect your child may have autism, don’t delay, there is help.<BR>&nbsp; </LI></UL>

Or maybe because she is still so young ( 16 <br />months) and these 'symptoms" are just now really coming to light... so she is <br />not too far gone yet... maybe? I dunno? sorry for threadjacking!Leila's mom....&nbsp;from what I've read and heard&nbsp;that is quite normal for kids on the spectrum.&nbsp; I've often "complained" to our social worker about this calling Jason Jykal and Hyde <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley36.gif" border="0">&nbsp; But some days he seems perfectly normal and other days the only way he'd be more obviously on the spectrum is if I tattoed it to his forehead!! <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley2.gif" border="0">&nbsp;<P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Same w/ my son Jill as to what you said. Seemed to be pretty "normal" until around the 18mth mark too. Ok the not responding to name and little interest in people thing I noticed early when I think back. Didn't think anything of it back then though, but my stepmom did. So he had some of the early signs I guess.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New">Amber</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>When I think back, I realize that Ansley had all of the early warning signs at every level.......heck, we're still working on most of them. <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley19.gif" border="0"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=3>I don't know if it's b/c she was our second child and I thought I was such an "old pro" at mothering, but I was much more relaxed with her and didn't worry&nbsp;so much over every single milestone - if I had I probably would have realized sooner.&nbsp; I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;we used to say that Ansley was&nbsp;"laid-back" or that she was "not a performer"....and that she just seemed to be "staying a baby" for SO long (she still is).&nbsp; I even remember crying to dh one night about how I felt so guilty b/c I just didn't feel that same connection and bond that I had with Hannah when&nbsp;she was an infant. <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley19.gif" border="0">&nbsp; Now it all makes sense.&nbsp; When I finally understood why I was feeling these things (because Ansley cannot engage normally) it made it easier to get beyond the "feeling" of distance - KWIM? Bless her heart, she gets so much love heaped on her, she can't help but placate us with a few "blow-kisses" and hugs now and then! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=3>It was around 20 months that we started really thinking something was wrong.&nbsp; Of course it took dh longer than me to realize.&nbsp; She did lose the few words she had, but the behavior didn't really regress, it just stayed the same.&nbsp; I think also at that age it became more noticeable b/c all of her peers were moving out of the "baby" stage and she wasn't.</FONT></P>We noticed at 4 months when all of a sudden our son started head banging. No words at 16 moths. No babels/smiles til after 9 months once he had tubes in ears added. All motor skills delayed. Hard to console.Poor eye contact. Still cares less about have a social life much. He is 9 now.That is a great list.&nbsp; I can add one from research we were
involved in here.&nbsp; If you get a child engaged with a toy, and then
put your hand on it, so as to stop them playing.&nbsp; An NT child will
look at your face to see why you have interrupted them, to check that
there isn't a problem.&nbsp; A child in the spectrum will just keep
looking at the toy and tugging it and will probably not look at you at
all, or if they do it will be after quite a while.&nbsp; Try this one
on any NT kid and then on your own and you will be quite amazed at the
difference. This was going to be part of an early screening tool for
Autism and also Aspergers.<br>
<br>
Also have a look at www.firstsigns.org/downloads/m-chat.PDF for a printable early screening tool designed for 18 month olds.<br>
<br>
We all know the earlier the better for intervention.<br>

<P>Cherylann,</P>
<P>How old were the children that you put your hands on the toy? Because I've done that with my son (who is 4.5 years old) and he does look at me within a second or two. He is on the very mild end of the spectrum (and there are many days, especially recently, that I wonder if the diagnosis was right - maybe I'm in that old river deNILE?). He has a PDD-NOS diagnosis as he didn't meet the criteria for either Asperger's or HFA, but had some autistic-like traits.</P>I am curious on the age for this one too??? Sorry,&nbsp; I should have said.&nbsp; They were in the 12 - 18 month
range.&nbsp; They haven't assessed this test with older children.&nbsp;
I would suspect that older kids have learned to refer to people in
situations they don't understand.
Oh good!!&nbsp; I tried that with my almost 7 month old and he was clueless!! Worried me!!&nbsp; Thanks!! <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley2.gif" border="0">I will try this in the morning! We shall see. <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>We had done that "test" with Ansley when she was younger, and of course she didn't look at us, just tried to move our hand or ignored us.&nbsp; But after reading this, I wondered if she would do better now that she is older.&nbsp; I tried it with her and she didn't ever look at me.&nbsp; I tried several times and one time she laughed and thought it was funny, but she never looked up, just tried to move my hand. <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley19.gif" border="0"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=3>My dh asked what on earth I was doing and I sadly explained it to him....He said, "Umm, I hate to break it to you but she IS autistic."&nbsp; I think he thought he was being funny. <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley5.gif" border="0">&nbsp;I KNOW she's autistic, DUH! I just wondered if she would have done better on this "test" now than she did when she was 20 months..........she has made some improvements in other areas after all.</FONT></P>I'm sorry that you didn't get a better result.&nbsp; However I would
use it as an opportunity to teach her to refer to people.&nbsp; Do the
test then physically prompt her to look up and then when she does
release the toy. I would also say "Good Looking". Use a toy that she
loves a lot and then you will have a very good natural reinforcer. You
could also use some food rewards as well.<br>
<br>
I did this one with my DD and I'm sure that it was very helpful for
her. Before I taught her to look up she had the same response.&nbsp; If
Ansley learns this skill it will be a way to teach her to refer to
people in all situations eventually. That's a skill our kids are so
deficient in. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Thanks for the tip, Cherylann!&nbsp; We actually do a lot of activities to encourage "good looking" - I guess that's why I was hoping that she would do better on this "test."&nbsp; I guess that she's not generalizing very well.........<IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley13.gif" border="0">.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=3>I'm going to work on this some tomorrow&nbsp;using your technique.&nbsp; Thank you! <IMG src="http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/smileys/smiley1.gif" border="0"></FONT></P><!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
