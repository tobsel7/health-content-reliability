<p>A <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-cap-and-trade-approach.htm'>cap and trade</a> system is a method for managing <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-cities-have-the-worst-pollution.htm'>pollution</a>, with the end goal of reducing the overall pollution in a nation, region, or industry. Many proponents of pollution control support the concept of cap and trade systems, arguing that they are extremely effective, and that they make sense economically as well. Such a system is only one option among many for reducing the emission of pollutants, most notably <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-carbon.htm'>carbon</a> dioxide, a <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-greenhouses.htm'>greenhouse</a> gas which has attracted a great deal of attention due to its environmental impacts.</p><div id="ad_block_1" style="height: 130px"></div>

<p>Under a cap and trade system, a government authority first sets a <em>cap</em>, deciding how much pollution in total will be allowed. Next, companies are issued credits, essentially licenses to pollute, based on how large they are, what industries they work in, and so forth. If a company comes in below its cap, it has extra credits which it may <em>trade</em> with other companies.</p>
<p>For companies which come in below their caps, a cap and trade system is great, because they can sell their extra credits, profiting while reducing their pollution. For companies which cannot get their pollution under control, a cap and trade system penalizes them for their excess pollution while still bringing overall pollution rates down. In a sense, the need to purchase credits acts as a fine, encouraging companies to reduce their <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-emissions.htm'>emissions</a>.</p>
<p>By creating a cap, nations make it clear that they want to reduce overall emissions, rather than just fining companies for excessive emissions or trying to force all companies to reduce their emissions by a set percentage. Cap and trade systems allow for flexibility, which usually benefits the market. Some people view the cap and trade concept as preferable to a taxation or fining system, because it is easier to administer and it results in a pollution reduction. These systems are most commonly used for <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-carbon-emissions.htm'>carbon emissions</a>, leading people to refer to it as “<a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-carbon-trading.htm'>carbon trading</a>,” and there is a potential for a global carbon trading market, in which more efficient nations could trade credits with other countries.
<p>A cap and trade system still requires regulation, obviously. Government agencies must monitor emissions from companies to ensure that they are reporting their emissions truthfully, for example, and companies can still be fined for releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, water, or soil. Cap and trade systems also benefit from investment in alternative energy on the part of the government, providing additional incentive to convert to more energy efficient and less polluting ways of generating energy to run companies, from <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-paper-mills.htm'>paper mills</a> to <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-computer.htm'>computer</a> <a href='http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-manufacturers.htm'>manufacturers</a>.</p>

			Global warming is real. Man-made global warming is not. When Mt St. Helens erupted it released more pollution than mankind has ever produced. <p>In the USA, the amount of pollution released in the industrial age was somewhere between 2,000,000 and 270,000,000 times the pollution that we release today. In 1975 the Time magazine front cover headline was &quot;Global Cooling will destroy mankind by the year 2050.&quot; The author is one of the many who now says man-made global warming is destroying the earth! Al Gore quotes him 22 times in his book! <p>You people have relied on the media for your information. Take an afternoon and do just a little historical research. There has never been any, none, zero proof that mankind has had any effect on the earth's temperature. <p>The earth's temperature cycles for many reasons none can be attributed to mankind. Al Gore knows this. He is a man who has personally profited just under one billion dollars by claiming we can have an affect on the earth's temps. <p>This billionaire, according to his tax returns, donated $7,381.00 to charities last year including church tithes. <p>I made $88,611.00 last year and donated $21,231.00 to charities and my church. Al Gore is a low life piece of work snake oil salesman and this world is just stupid enough to buy into all this bull!		</div>

			I can remember back in the days of 23 cents per gallon gasoline, and trolley cars moving people from point A to point B, then somebody (GMC)had the great idea to replace the trolley with buses, which they just happened to manufacture. After that, gas kept going up and so did the pollution. Maybe it's time to go back to trolleys again!		</div>

			Cap And Trade (CAT) Does anyone suppose this is an actual fix to global warming? Who has the carbon credits? Who sells them? What do they do with the money? Are you taxed when you buy them? If there aren't enough who makes more?  The government comes up with new ways to get their hands into you pockets all the time.  Wait till they pass the value added tax. Does anyone know how another tax will add value to what I buy? <p>Why is it they ask the people who plan and budget their money to supply the government who won't?  		</div>

			It looks like this is now the second biggest oil spill in the history of mankind! It will soon reach number one if not stopped. At least BP has found a good way to get rid of their toxic waste. Call it dispersant and dump it in the Gulf of Mexico. I don’t think it will be safe to touch water in the Gulf of Mexico for the rest of the decade. They may as well close it down.		</div>

			BP will not pay for all this! They will disperse the vast wealth among the oil tycoons and then declare bankruptcy. Ha Ha they are smarter than everyone else.<p>More mega yachts!<p>Oil tycoons always lie and they will do anything for more money and power. They don’t care how much damage and death they cause. That explains why BP lies all the time. Oil tycoons have owned our government for a long time. The government’s main purpose is to make money for Oil tycoons.		</div>

			Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. What would the global warming zealots like us to exhale? Cap and Trade is just another bad idea of a politically popular idea coupled with flawed science.        		</div>

			The idea of Cap and Trade was started back in the 80's and the law came into being in 1990 (Clean Air Act). Why? Acid rain and sulfur dioxide. As a result of the Act there was a reduction in Acid rain of at least 50 percent. The reason it works is that there was a cap. <p>Initially, it started trading at $250 per ton. But that is not the problem here. The problem is not Cap and Trade. Cap and Trade is a method of dealing with a certain problem, but I cannot see how it can be applied. <p>Here are some examples. These are all factual. By retrofitting old buildings one would reduce greenhouse gases and create jobs. By how much? More than any type of cap and trade. More jobs than you would create through coal powered plants or through solar powered, etc. (I think that for 1 billion of retrofits there are 7,000 jobs created.) By simply changing the traffic lights in each city and changing rooftops in each city there would be enough savings in greenhouse gases to be more than all transportation (which represents 10 percent of greenhouse emissions). <p>Tropical deforestation represents 15 percent of the total carbon. How can cap and trade help us out with that? <p>There is a logical fallacy called a non-sequitur. When the basis of your argument has nothing to do with your conclusion, that is a non-sequitur and that is what this cap and trade is. We are being sold a bunch of non-sequiturs. <p>Let us start with what we know and let us create jobs for America. Start with fixing our buildings. Start with electric and hybrid cars but no taxes on them. Build refueling stations for them. Start with cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico and ensuring that such an oil spill never happens again. Start with making a level playing field but making sure that the tropical rain forest is not being cut down. Get China to stop spewing garbage. India as well. 		</div>

			Cap and trade? Should be called Cap and charade! Just another government scam. We have a coal facility that produces electricity that burns very clean. If it's not broke, don't fix it. Just like global warming. We're enjoying thirty two degree nights in May. Burned more firewood this year than the last two. We can thank Al Gore for saving us water also.<p>The new toilets with smaller capacity only take two or three flushes to do what we did with one. Do the math. Less efficient and uses more water. I guess Al doesn't mind as he just bought another little house for about eight million dollars. As they say, follow the money. <p>The Freddy and Fannie fiasco. Who benefited from this? Not the people who bought a house that they could not afford. Some used a credit card to make a down payment. Interest upon interest! Do the math. Doomed for failure! <p>Bottom line: too much government and deceit gets you this. Time to wake up, go to the voting booth and remove the people who got us here and continue on the same path. Let 2010 and 2012 start anew and bring back America as we once knew!  		</div>

			With Climategate we have already proved that man made climate change is a farce. Any reference to reducing greenhouse gases for the means to the ends should be dismissed. So how can we promote a program that would not reduce pollution just shifts the polluters' amount. This is totally a shell game designed to enrich the designers of this program. Just follow the money. 		</div>

			It would seem that in recent years, especially the last two or so, everything is driving towards massive federal expansion.<p>Cap and Trade is going to create more jobs because somebody has to monitor the companies, keep track of who has how many credits.  Essentially, bean counters.<p>Let's take a look at the health care bill.  We are talking about expanding the IRS by 30,000 jobs, and not one new doctor. How is this affecting my health?<p>Now they want to reform Wall Street. I'm sure they will come up with some brilliant plan to create a whole bunch of new federal jobs, levy more taxes to pay for those, that will ultimately come out of the pockets of the lowest man on the totem pole.<p>The big buzz they love though is &quot;credits&quot; and not &quot;refunds&quot;. Tax credits only matter for when you pay in. They raise taxes, then give certain people credits. That's great. What if you are poor, or didn't make much money? That credit does nothing to put food on your table. They can hand out all the credits they like because if you didn't pay into the federal taxes, you get nothing. So, in reality, all the credits offered end up not being worth anything.		</div>

			Cap and Trade is a scam, and has nothing to do with protecting the environment. In fact, all it does is encouraging the big polluter to pollute further - all they'll have to do is buy some &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;the right to pollute&quot;. So you, the consumer, will struggle to find green ways of living, so that &quot;they&quot; can benefit from that and go ahead doing what they have done all along.<p>Not to mention the so-called &quot;green taxes&quot; which will fall upon the regular citizen.<p>Sad world are we living in.		</div>

			To Anon77819: Cap and trade will cost a fortune, drive up prices of everything, and make a bunch of carbon speculators rich. <p>You wonder what those of us who doubt, have to gain? You should be asking where all this cap and trade money will be going. If I have to pay a dollar a gallon more for gas, who gets it? Or, who gets the extra money we will have to pay for everything?<p>I'll tell you this: the extra money I don't have to pay for everything will allow me to purchase other things I need. This will help the economy. If you think  the few jobs created by hiring more IRS agents and other government positions will help our economy, and that cap and trade is the GW cure-all, then you better start paying attention to what's happening in this country.  		</div>

			I think the majority of these posts are from ill informed people on both sides. <p>I also think that we all need to get out of our comfort zones and get our information from sources that don't massage our personal ideology. <p>Many on the right only get their information from sources that are biased on the right and might misrepresent the issues, and the same goes for those on the left. <p>I suggest we all spend a little time looking elsewhere for our information, and instead of mocking and ridiculing those of differing opinions, we should try to understand why they think that way, and ask ourselves what the facts are (not the convenient talking points). <p>We also need to ask ourselves what makes a newscaster, talk show host or radio personality offer a particular opinion. <p>In this case, who has the most to gain by convincing us that pollution is not destroying our planet? <p>What do we have to lose by protecting it, and what if those of us who deny the impact on our environment are wrong?		</div>

			You all are misinformed. First of all, those of you complaining about pollution (I will only listen to those who are Amish or you are a hypocrite and get the advantages of the american revolution). Second, God is in control and if you believe in God, then the bible warns us of earthquakes, floods, etc. If you're not a Christian, then look back in history and explain the ice age/the worse earthquakes and floods even prior to America being founded? Got any explanations for this when there was no company pollution. Stop blaming, being ignorant to facts on history, and what the Bible says. Our politicians (Gore especially) are making money off your ignorance.		</div>

			Hey post 102: It's not normal to have a size 14 waist in America, either. And since when have we been pointing the finger at China? Other than when we are pointing at the people who buy our T-bills. <p>We use what we need. We don't take things, we buy them. We consume what we can afford (for the most part) and we eat until we're full (and we grow all the food ourselves). <p>Define fair share. What have we used so much of that there is just none of it left for anyone?  <p>Yes, Americans are greedy. But we're not the only ones. I mean, if it wasn't for greed, why would you even have a job? Because you don't want things? Or are you one of those types who does nothing and just asks for government handouts?<p>Carbon emissions are an externality of heavy industry. By granting the right to sell carbon as property, a market is created. And in this market you're going to have players who want to cut a profit. <p>There are financial incentives for entities in the carbon market who can innovate ways to reduce emissions in a cost effective manner. These firms will win in the long run, as firms that pollute rampantly will incur such high added costs that they will cease to operate. <p>Of course there will be entities that take advantage of faults in the system, but that happens in every system, everywhere. It's just how capitalism works.<p>Sure, the prices of things will probably go up, that's something that happens when you impose restrictions like this. Now I'm no hardcore environmentalist, but wouldn't you rather pay a little bit more for stuff, and buy a little bit less of it, rather than risk damaging the planet to a point beyond repair? <p>So, let's here a better idea on how to mitigate carbon emissions. Do nothing? Say it's not allowed at all? Learn to compromise people. 		</div>

			Unfortunately I am stuck with research on the effectiveness of the 'cap and trade/emissions trading policies', I looked at the posts merely for public opinion.<p>To be honest, I agree with some of you. It just won't work.<p>Why? Because Americans are greedy. <p>You use more than you need, you take more than you need, you consume more that you need, and by gosh you eat more than you need! You take more than your fair share in everything other than anything that is rational.<p>In my country, it isn't normal to be a size 14.<p>Oh, and stop pointing the fingers at china, india or developing countries. Because you are the problems. You have been the naughty fat kid that ate it all, and you didn't leave anything for the rest of us.		</div>

			okay, now I've read a few more. Instead of relying on this article for your sole knowledge base, maybe try expanding your minds and take a look at the world around you. <p>Have you noticed the amount of random catastrophes that have been happening in the past few years? Massive floods, New Orleans, Haiti. The list is becoming endless. <p>Global warming is not just the warming of temperatures, it's an alteration of the balance. El nino is warming up and there is scientific evidence that coastal cities will flood, within our lifetime! <p>The evidence of how much melting is occurring in the Arctic/Antarctic regions. While the warming may be a cycle, we are making it come faster, and at the same time we're destroying everything around us. Check out the mass number of extinctions that occur every day. <p>Wake up people, how can you be so closed minded and ignore what is right in front of your face. If you need an easy source to understand the issue, pick up a national geographic. And while yes other countries have a slightly higher output of pollution than the United States, look at your population numbers! <p>China, India, middle-eastern countries, Africa, they all have at least twice the people and yet the Americans are still able to match their pollution emissions. I don't know about, but that is sick! Please do your research, this is happening.		</div>

			I can't say that I have read all of these comments, however of the 6/7 I did read, you all criticise the environment. Why? Especially since the United States is one of the biggest polluters in the world with relatively few people in respect to other countries such as India and China. <p>No this system is not perfect, but at least it's a step to minimize our footprint on Earth. I can understand how people are struggling because of the economy, but to say that you think Obama should be focusing his time on this and only this is ludicrous. The economy will get better, it always does. The Earth, it won't get better.		</div>

			Obama's call for a televised bipartisan get- together to discuss health care reform is a farce. He will make some grand prepared speech, and when the GOP doesn't totally fall all over itself agreeing with him, he will use that as an excuse to have the house pass the senate bill and cram it down our throats.  <p>They will then use the senate to vote most of the house portions separately. We will end up with most of the house version, which no one wants.  You heard it here.		</div>

			Obama does not care about the environment. Cap and Trade is nothing more than a scheme to steal and redirect our tax money.  <p>Example: His cash for clunkers program was pitched as a way to green the planet by getting gas guzzlers off the road. But in fact, you got more incentives to trade to another vehicle in your same class and you had to have less fuel economy improvement to do so.  <p>In other words, you could trade in a 14 mpg gas-guzzling pickup truck for a new 16 mpg gas-guzzling pickup truck and get the full $4500, while a guy driving a Toyota that got 25 mpg got nothing if he traded to a 35 mpg car. <p>Figure it out. C for C was a scheme to funnel your tax money into the pockets of the corrupt, lazy auto makers who squandered 10 years making gas-hogging SUVs instead of efficient cars.<p>Cap and Trade is the same thing -- a corrupt mechanism that Obama will use to reward wealthy, powerful, corporate cronies, just like all the bail-out money he slid into the pockets of the corrupt banks and investment companies that screwed this economy in the first place.<p>He ran on the &quot;I'm not like G. W. Bush&quot; mantra.<p>Change? You must be joking. Obama is everything bad about Bush times 10, wrapped in a phony liberal cloak.		</div>

			Ok, I'll bite.  First, the earth is coming ou of an ice age, and has been gradually warming since humans began keeping accurate climatic records (long before the industrial revolution).  <p>Second, there is no empirical evidence that man has, in any way, accelerated this warming. <p>Third, we can all agree that pollution is bad.  Cap and Trade though, is the equivalent of gun control. Outlaw guns, and the law-abiding will turn theirs in - the criminals won't.  <p>We limit carbon emissions in the US, while China and the third world continue polluting. We can't compete economically, if we're not playing by the same rules.  <p>I will stand behind cap and trade when the UN imposes and enforces a complete economic embargo on any nation who violates the agreement. Yeah, like that's gonna happen.  <p>C&amp;T is a nice idea, that in the real world, will never work. It's a fool's errand. Guess that's why the dems love it so much - they're fools.  Lastly, Al Gore did not keep us safe for eight years. The Clinton / Gore administration laid the foundation for 9/11 by way of a complete disinterest in our counter-terrorism capability, and our military in general.		</div>

			I've read many good posts here. We are in serious danger of economic collapse, if TARP and the massive health care bill doesn't bring it on Cap and Trade will finish us off. We're headed for one world government and Obama and his crew of socialists are doing the bidding of a handful of international agents who have long awaited this. I also believe nothing happens without the Almighty allowing it for His own purposes. As a nation we have not appreciated our blessings, we are ungrateful and have ventured into evils that my grandmother's generation could not imagine.

Live in the country earning the salaries, paying the taxes, trying to get an education, or better yet a job.

We are going back to whence our ancestors escaped, whence immigrants continue to escape to eat the crumbs of our freedom we so carelessly take advantage of. <p>There are all sorts of variations on the socialization to check out, go be one with them.

			An experiment was done, many years ago, using a very large grove of trees (a small forest you might say). One half of the grove had pipes installed, running underneath the trees. These pipes had CO2 pumped through them. The other half of the grove was left untouched by the extra CO2. Researchers assumed that the growth of the "CO2" trees would be affected but never dreamed just how much. The "CO2 trees were about 20 percent taller and had about 40 percent more canopy volume than the non-"CO2" trees. The bottom line. The more CO2 you gave the trees, the faster and larger they grew. They handled it. I'm not going to sit here and say that people who speak negatively about CO2 emissions are idiots. They are not. They are people who are passionate about ours and our world's health. What I have not seen is the coming together, in a public venue, of scientists from both sides of the argument that have they're facts and the reliable data to back it up. Present it to the nations, let it be debated based on information that can be duplicated by other scientists, and let the public have access to this information. A televised presentation would be great. How about it scientists? If you can back it up then put it out there for debate.    		</div>

They have many faces and many hats; it does not matter, republican or democrat or whatever. Stop fighting among yourselves. Democrats, Republican, Libertarians, Liberals and Socialist united as Americans. Stop hating and arguing - nobody is going to destroy you but yourself if you continue on this path. <p>There is nothing wrong with capitalism and wealth creation; it is needed and the markets know that. There is nothing wrong with providing the environment that will give incentives to empower the individual to be as rich as he can be as long that individual carries the moral, character and social responsibility that comes with the territory.   <p>There is nothing wrong with socialism, since social justice is imperative to any decent, moral human being. As long as pseudo socialism does not cut your freedom to express your ideas, voice and sentiments and does not turn the government into a totalitarian government, nothing is wrong with it.<p>So, stop and unite if you want America to continue living!<p>I think you can start by reforming health care for now and even if it is run by your current government. If there was money for "unexplainable"  or hard to understand war, there will be money to take care of the sick. 		</div>

			When are we going to realize that the more government is involved in our lives the worse off we'll be?  We all cry, "Less government", but on the other hand we want the government to "take care of us."  Cap and Trade is another way we relinquish more control to the government. I hope we wake up before it is too late.		</div>

			Conservative like-mindedness seems to be showing up in anything President Obama and Congress tries to do. Equating an attempt to control pollution and climate change with "socialism" is highly illogical. We will have private industry in energy and healthcare as well as banking. Government is involved to regulate unfettered capitalism, which you would have to be totally ignorant to believe really works. We had a democratically held election in 2008 reflecting dissatisfaction with 8 years of conservative, Republican government starting unnecessary wars and allowing the economy to deteriorate. Our current cooperative foreign policy, our concern about energy and finding alternatives, and the using of government funds to do what the private sector cannot in order to reinvigorate our economy all are leading to better outcomes than if we did nothing.		</div>

			The "pollutor" is you! listen to the language these marxists use. when they say only the rich will pay, that's you and me! In all of the world, the poorest among us are the richest among them. If you voted for Obama, you will be ashamed to admit it by the time his first term is over. but there will be a war that magically lands in his lap around 2012, because they know that statistically, a president is much less likely to be voted out in time of war. They play pollitics with our very lives. With our lives! Us! We The People! They work for us! So let's do all of us a favor and make sure that there is a massive turnover in Washington during these next three election cycles. <p>They will use the same tired line, "my opponent is a radical," or, "not experienced." well, look where all of this experience has got us?<p>Whoever is in office now that votes for tax & kill (cap & trade for the evironmentalists) or any who vote for universal healthcare reform, (lipstick on a pig) needs to be voted out, regardless of their opponent's views. The next batch could not possibly do a worse job. We <p>run this country! They work for us! Let's fire them all!<p>		</div>

			Hey guys, the government needs this tax so they can feed, house, and provide birth control for those 600 horses that nobody wants! 'Course the problem *could* be taken care of with about $200 in bullets. Hey then you could use the leftovers to feed all the dogs nobody wants, but all the bleeding-hearts say we should pay to house and feed! And to think these are the same people who think it is OK to kill your unborn child, because the government should *not* be able to tell you what to do with *your* body? What a joke. So $7 billion minus 200 is what? Whatever it is we could send it to China to pay off our debt. I wonder how many Chinese people have a place to live, food, lights, clothes, TV, etc. that the Chinese government pays for?		</div>

			The trees in the Great Smokey Mountains are suffering from a European born disease that was brought to our country. Get your facts straight and stop listening to the liberal bias media liars. This country is on the fast track to communism and they are using cap and trade to finish off our economy and our currency value. This is being done to create chaos among us so martial law can be declared therefor the Dems cannot be voted out of power and they may proceed to mold our once great nation into a socialist and elitest society. Mexican and Canadian military has already been authorized to enter and police us when anarchy strikes. Please look at the big picture folks. The new Amero dollar has already been designed and is awaiting distribution after the N. American Union has been formed in the very near future. All I can say is prepare yourselves and bury all the guns, ammunition and supplies that you can. Good luck to my fellow patriots and death to the marxist, communist sheeple. At least the weak lefties will be mostly incapable of defending themselves. Our biggest concern will be the military. "against all enemies foreign and domestic." Good luck.		</div>

			It's amazing how ignorant most of you are about the environment and the undeniable scientific proof behind global climate change theory.  We aren't talking the same kind of theory that you would throw Jesus Christ and Buddha into, we are talking about a scientific hypothesis that has been supported by so much evidence that its existence is irrefutable by modern science.  So you greedy business men and pathetic conservatives need to either A) educate yourselves or B) stop reproducing so the rest of us human beings can begin making headway on the massive amount of damage we have done to the world we live in.  Cap and trade is a great start and I am proud to see that President Obama is getting the U.S. back on the bandwagon, but this is only the start.

He and clinton did nothing but run down the military and did nothing about the looming housing crisis...along with Barney Frank and Chris Dodd.......what a bunch of looney tunes!!!  <p><p>And now we have all the wonderful dems in office kissing the rear end of Obama while passing mountains of legislation they they did *not even read*!!!!  People, we are in deep do do when congress passes bills that they haven't even read!!  About 3 more years and you'll see a lot of Dems out of office.  *I hope*!!

			There are two issues, one) is there actually global warming and 2) if there is, is it caused by humans.<p><p>The second point is NOT PROVABLE. Let's look at the first. If there's global warming, we should be breaking high temperature records all over the globe. We are not. In fact, we are breaking cold records. Secondly, the greenhouse effect is supposed to hold in heat so that the temperature continues to trend higher. A simple test for this is what happens at night when the sun sets. Guess what, it's not warmer at night and the delta between day and night hasn't changed.<p><p>The enemies of what was the greatest nation that ever was are winning because we have become ignorant, confused sheep.

Did you see your energy costs and cost of living go down? Utility costs tripled, jobs were lost, and our standard of living nose dived. The filthy rich only want to get richer. If we don't see this bill passed, can we expect to enjoy this current prosperity of low energy costs? Wake up ditto heads and neocons.

China is polluting on a scale not seen since the industrial revolution.  Look at the big picture.  The cost burden of cap and trade will be passed on to the consumer, not the so called polluter.  It's just one more thing to cripple the economy.  All this nonsense helps China get stronger while we get weaker.<p>Our steel making industry has been brought to it's knees while China just built two new super mills which employ thousands.  American corporations move to foreign countries because they aren't taxed out of existence and harassed by an environmental protection agency.<p>With all of this going on, all you can think about is that there might be global warming.  It's a shame that you only listen to the few scientists that use junk science to make a case for global warming but you don't listen to the other side.

All one has to do is see the devastating effects of the environment on the trees in the Great Smoky mountains to know that *something* is wrong.<p><p>We need to collectively learn as a nation that there *are* things more important than money.		</div>

			In the carbon credit system a farmer does what he normally does, a factory does what it normally does. The only thing that changes is that the government forces the factory to buy carbon credits and gives the money to the farmer. Once again it's just the government stealing money from one group of people and giving it to another. Nothing else changes. *Wake up America*!		</div>

			Cap and trade is a farce. <p>By allowing the purchase of credits, the message is "pollute as much as you like, just pay for it, and you're off guilt-free."<p>The most glaring and obvious example? None other than the Global Warming Svengali, Al Gore. While lecturing the rest of us about curtailing our carbon emissions, he merrily consumes 20 times as much energy as normal folks, but buys "credits" to "ensure carbon-neutrality."<p>What a load of carbon-emitting crap. <p>This is nothing more than a get-rich-quick scheme for those who become "brokers" of these meaningless credits. Americans have become so dumbed-down that we just accept whatever the anointed spew, and we do it at our own peril.<p>Obama admitted that the Cap and Trade he espouses will bankrupt the Coal industry. All that will do is make YOUR electric bill skyrocket as your provider is forced to use inefficient, horribly expensive ways to produce energy. Get ready, this is gonna hurt.<p>		</div>
