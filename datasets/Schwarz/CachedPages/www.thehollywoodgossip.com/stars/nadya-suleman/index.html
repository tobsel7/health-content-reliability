<h2>Bio</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nadya Suleman, a.k.a. Octomom, is an attention-loving, certifiably insane lady who gained international attention when she gave birth to octuplets in January 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are only the second full set of octuplets to be born alive in the U.S., and were conceived via in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with the aid of a male friend who provided donor sperm and is the biological father. Way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The circumstances of Nadya Suleman's multiple birth have led to controversy in the field of assisted reproductive technology as well as an investigation of the fertility specialist involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Public reaction began to turn on Octomom when it was discovered that the single mother already had six young children at home at the time and was not financially independent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>That's right, Nadya Suleman, who now has 14 frickin' kids, was unemployed and on public assistance programs.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She married Marcos Gutierrez in 1996.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They separated in 2000 due to - guess what - their inability to conceive children. Way to go, Marcos Gutierrez. See what you've done to society as a result?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gutierrez filed for divorce in November 2006 and the divorce was finalized in January 2008. Just in time for her to get knocked up with eight kids.</p>

		<p>Hey----A devil's advocate/Nadya:<br />
<br />
Nadya Suleman DID NOT make a mistake. She deliberately did this to herself . She is the one who went in to a doctor's office and chose to have ELEVEN embryos stuffed up her uterus when medical guidelines say that for a woman her age TWO is the limit. What kind of "mistake" exactly was that? Unfortunately she has done that to 14 kids and her parents too.<br />
<br />
Devil's Advocate is likely Nadya on her kid's meds being p.o.'d that people are making money off her that she can't claim a share of.<br />
kristy is obviously Cristina -- Toxomom's friend who's been making ROL money off this too.		</p>

		<p>This really is sick.  There are so many wonderful women in the world that would make great mothers and unfortunately do not have any children and then you have waste of life females like her that already had six no need to have any more and she goes and uses in-vitro to get pregnantr again.  Poor babies thwey should be put up for adoption so they can go to a mother who would really want to be a mother		</p>

		<p><b>I think it's disgusting your all against her.</b><br />
<br />
<i>What really has she really done wrong?? </i><br />
Not wanting to selectively kill her children?<br />
Wanting to give them a better life by working hard?<br />
Actually having children?<br />
<br />
'justbecause', onto your quote that the children need a father figure, maybe so but thats also laughable, alot of people are single mums and the kids turn out just fine. Not really a reason for such hatred, is it now?<br />
<br />
And incase you didn't know, she actually doesn't live off tax payers money, target the scumbag who sit around watching tv all day waiting to pick up their benefits; not a single mum trying her hardest to raise a family the only way she knows how.<br />
<br />
You people all need to get a grip, leave this poor woman alone and get on with your own pitiful and obviously mundane lives.<br />
<br />
Good luck Nadya<br />

		<p>i seriously doubt the mental capabilities of Nadya. She constantly spouts knowledge of psychology and doesn't get that she's ill herself! Those poor babies are with a nut case. Here she is trying to be the "woman of the year", its laughable. Although, I am not a big "Jon &amp; Kate" fan, Kate has a better grip on parenting kids. At least, Kate's children have a FATHER...that makes a HUGE difference. Its sad that Nadya lives in a fantasy land, her kids are all acting out and the babies all seemed to be unhappy and crying. Her toddlers are slapping her and calling her names, the older kids don't listen to her and are unhappy and unruly. Pitiful, its a shame that Nadya is soooo stubborn, jealous and a wannabe..Kate is better looking and Kate did the right thing for HERSELF by getting a tummy tuck. Thats her right to do that for HERSELF. Nadya seems to have been a spoiled brat herself growing up. She ripped Kates photo on tv and tosses it in the trash. Nadya, you will never come close to being the mom that Kate is. Grow up, get help and let someone with a brain help you raise these children. I pray for these poor children. They will be disfunctional there is no way around it. Nadya, wake up!!!!!!!!!!!!		</p>
