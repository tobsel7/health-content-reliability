  <title>FactCheck.org: Born in the U.S.A.</title>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
  <meta name="description" content="In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate to quell speculative charges that he might not be a natural-born citizen. But the image prompted more blog-based skepticism about the document's authenticity. And recently, author Jerome Corsi, whose book attacks Obama, said in a TV interview that the birth certificate the campaign has is "fake."

We beg to differ. FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false. We have posted high-resolution photographs of the document as "supporting documents" to this article. Our conclusion: Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said.">

<em>Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaii&rsquo;s Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.</em><br />
</font></div><div class="article_section_header"><span>Analysis</span></div><div class="article_section"><em><font size="3">Update Nov. 1: The <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iw1At-4G1xuE50oXVFRlBPfR3dqgD945OLU00">Associated Press quoted </a></font><font size="3"><a href="javascript:void(0);/*1225579409906*/">Chiyome Fukino </a>as saying </font><font size="3">that both she and the&nbsp; registrar of vital statistics, Alvin Onaka, have personally verified that the health department holds Obama's original birth certificate.<br />
<br />
Fukino also was quoted by several other news organizations. <a href="http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20081101/NEWS05/811010345/1001/localnewsfront">The Honolulu Advertiser quoted Fukino </a>as saying the agency had been bombarded by requests, and that the registrar of statistics had even been called in at home in the middle of the night.<br />
</font></em><blockquote><em><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Honolulu Advertiser, Nov. 1 2008: </strong>&quot;This has gotten ridiculous,&quot; state health director Dr. Chiyome Fukino said yesterday. &quot;There are plenty of other, important things to focus on, like the economy, taxes, energy.&quot; . . .  Will this be enough to quiet the doubters? &quot;I hope so,&quot; Fukino said. &quot;We need to get some work done.&quot;</font></font><br />
</em></blockquote><font size="3"><em>Fukino said she has &ldquo;personally seen and verified that the Hawaii State Department of Health has Sen. Obama&rsquo;s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.&quot; </em><br />
<br />
Since we first <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/has_obamas_birth_certificate_been_disclosed.html">wrote</a> about Obama's birth certificate on June 16, speculation on his citizenship has continued apace. </font><font size="3">Some claim that Obama posted a fake birth certificate to his <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/invite/birthcert">Web page</a>. That charge leaped from the blogosphere to the mainstream media earlier this week when Jerome Corsi, author of a book attacking Obama, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtCiXDBak">repeated</a> the claim in an Aug. 15 interview with Steve Doocy on Fox News.</font><br />
<blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Corsi:</strong> Well, what would be really helpful is if Senator Obama would release primary documents like his birth certificate. The campaign has a false, fake birth certificate posted on their website. How is anybody supposed to really piece together his life?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Doocy:</strong> What do you mean they have a &quot;false birth certificate&quot; on their Web site?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Corsi:</strong> The original birth certificate of Obama has never been released, and the campaign refuses to release it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Doocy:</strong> Well, couldn't it just be a State of Hawaii-produced duplicate?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Corsi:</strong> No, it's a -- there's been good analysis of it on the Internet, and it's been shown to have watermarks from Photoshop. It's a fake document that's on the Web site right now, and the original birth certificate the campaign refuses to produce.<br />
</font></p>
</blockquote>        <font size="3">Corsi isn't the only skeptic claiming</font><font size="3"> that the document is a forgery. Among the most frequent objections we saw on forums, blogs and e-mails are:<br />
</font>
<ul>
    <li><font size="3">The birth certificate doesn't have a raised seal.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">It isn't signed.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">No creases from folding are evident in the scanned version.<br />
    </font></li>
    <li><font size="3">In the zoomed-in view, there's a strange halo around the letters.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">The certificate number is blacked out.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">The date bleeding through from the back seems to say &quot;2007,&quot; but the document wasn't released until 2008.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">The document is a &quot;certification of birth,&quot; not a &quot;certificate of birth.&quot;<br />
    </font></li>
</ul>
<font size="3">Recently FactCheck representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate, and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three-dimensional and resides at the Obama headquarters in Chicago. We can assure readers that the certificate does bear a raised seal, and that it's stamped on the back by Hawaii state registrar Alvin T. Onaka (who uses a signature stamp rather than signing individual birth certificates). We even brought home a few photographs.<br />

You can click on the photos to get full-size versions, which haven't been edited in any way, except that some have been rotated 90 degrees for viewing purposes.<br />
<br />
The certificate has all the elements the State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100004.pdf">requires</a> for proving citizenship to obtain a U.S. passport: &quot;</font><font size="3">your full name, the full name of your parent(s), date and place of birth, sex, date the birth record was filed, and the seal or other certification of the official custodian of such records.&quot;</font><font size="3"> The names, date and place of birth, and filing date are all evident on the scanned version, and you can see the seal above.<br />
<br />
The document is a &quot;certification of birth,&quot; also known as a short-form birth certificate. The long form is drawn up by the hospital and includes additional information such as birth weight and parents' hometowns. The short form is printed by the state and draws from a database with fewer details. The Hawaii Department of Health's <a href="http://hawaii.gov/health/vital-records/pdf/birth.pdf">birth record request form</a> does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long-form birth certificate, but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the State Department. We tried to ask the Hawaii DOH why they only offer the short form, among other questions, but they have not given a response.<br />
<br />
The scan released by the campaign shows halos around the black text, making it look (to some) as though the text might have been pasted on top of an image of security paper. But the document itself has no such halos, nor do the close-up photos we took of it. We conclude that the halo seen in the image produced by the campaign is a digital artifact from the scanning process.</font><font size="3" face="Arial"> <br />
<br />
</font><font size="3" face="Arial">We asked the Obama campaign about </font><font size="3" face="Arial">the date stamp and the blacked-out certificate number. The<font face="Arial"> certificate is stamped June 2007, because that's when Hawaii officials produced it for the campaign, which requested that document and &quot;</font>all the records we could get our hands on&quot; according to spokesperson Shauna Daly. The campaign didn't release its copy until 2008, after speculation began to appear on the Internet questioning Obama's citizenship. The campaign then rushed to release the document, and the rush is responsible for the blacked-out certificate number. Says Shauna: &quot;[We] couldn't get someone on the phone in Hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information, and we erred on the side of blacking it out. Since then we've found out it's pretty irrelevant for the outside world.&quot; The document we looked at did have a certificate number; it is 151 1961 - 010641.<br />

<font face="Arial"><em><font size="2">Blowup of certificate number</font></em></font></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some of the conspiracy theories that have circulated about Obama are quite imaginative. One conservative blogger <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/07/atlas-exclusive.html">suggested</a> that the campaign might have obtained a valid Hawaii birth certificate, soaked it in solvent, then reprinted it with Obama's information. Of course, this anonymous blogger didn't have access to the actual document and presents this as just one possible &quot;scenario&quot; without any evidence that such a thing actually happened or is even feasible.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">We also note that so far none of those questioning the authenticity of the document have produced a shred of evidence that the information on it is incorrect. Instead, some speculate that somehow, maybe, he was born in another country and doesn't meet the Constitution's requirement that the president be a &quot;natural-born citizen.&quot; <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">We think our colleagues at PolitiFact.com, who also dug into some of these loopy theories <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/jun/27/obamas-birth-certificate-part-ii/">put it pretty well</a>: &quot;It is possible that Obama conspired his way to the precipice of the world&rsquo;s biggest job, involving a vast network of people and government agencies over decades of lies. Anything&rsquo;s possible. But step back and look at the overwhelming evidence to the contrary and your sense of what&rsquo;s reasonable has to take over.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In fact, the conspiracy would need to be even deeper than our colleagues realized. In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the <em>Honolulu Advertiser</em> on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?template=zoom&amp;Site=M1&amp;Date=20081109&amp;Category=NEWS01&amp;ArtNo=811090361&amp;Ref=V3"><img height="99" width="303" alt="" src="http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/Ask%20FactCheck%20Images/Birth%20Certificate/announcementclose-up.jpg" /></a><br />
<em><font size="2"><font face="Times New Roman">Obama's birth announcement</font></font></em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><br />
The announcement was posted by a <a href="http://texasdarlin.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/obama-was-born-in-hawaii-wrong-can-of-worms/">pro-Hillary Clinton blogger</a> who grudgingly concluded that Obama &quot;likely&quot; was born Aug. 4, 1961 in Honolulu.</font></p>
<font size="3" face="Arial"> Of course, it's distantly possible that Obama's grandparents may have planted the announcement just in case their grandson needed to prove his U.S. citizenship in order to run for president someday. We suggest that those who choose to go down that path should first equip themselves with a high-quality tinfoil hat. The evidence is clear: Barack Obama was born in the U.S.A.<br />
<br />
<em>Update, August 26: We received responses to some of our questions from the Hawaii Department of Health. They couldn't tell us anything about their security paper, but they did answer another frequently-raised question: why is Obama's father's race listed as &quot;African&quot;? Kurt Tsue at the DOH told us that father's race and mother's race are supplied by the parents, and that &quot;we accept what the parents self identify themselves to be.&quot; We consider it reasonable to believe that Barack Obama, Sr., would have thought of and reported himself as &quot;African.&quot; It's certainly not the slam dunk some readers have made it out to be.<br />
<br />
When we asked about the security borders, which look different from some other examples of Hawaii certifications of live birth, Kurt said &quot;The borders are generated each time a certified copy is printed.  A citation located on the bottom left hand corner of the certificate indicates which date the form was revised.&quot; He also confirmed that the information in the short form birth certificate is sufficient to prove citizenship for &quot;all reasonable purposes.&quot;<br />
