					<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">Welcome to Reduce Debt Faster, a guide to helping everyone get out of debt as fast&#8211;and for as little money&#8211;as possible. This guide has been created because, now more than ever, millions of people are struggling with debt and are unsure of where to turn for help.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">We all see the commercials and ads making promises that are clearly too good to be true, and we have all heard of people being ripped off by some of these shady companies. So, this site has been set up as a factual, knowledgeable resource for reliable information on the best ways to reduce your debt.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 12px; display: block; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Debt Help and Credit Card Relief</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">These days, it seems as though banks, mortgage lenders, and credit card companies have gone to war with their own customers! Lenders are raising interest rates, slashing credit limits, and taking actions that actually hurt your credit score.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">This in turn leads to even higher interest rates and can actually cause you to fall behind or default on your debts, even if nothing else has changed.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">This of course hardly seems fair. Now, because of the new credit card law that has been passed and will take effect in 2010, banks are claiming that they must take action now to protect their profits.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">Fortunately, this law will help all of us in the future as will not be at the mercy of lenders like we are now. However, if you have a balance with your cards right now, you will have to deal with these ridiculous actions which could leave you in need of <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/get-credit-card-relief-without-getting-ripped-off/">credit card relief</a>.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 12px; display: block; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">How to Reduce Your Debt</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">With all of this going on, it is important to get out of debt as quickly as possible, right now. But how can you do that? Check out these 5 <a style="color: #8c9eaa; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/5-proven-methods-to-reduce-debt-fast/">ways to reduce debt</a> first. If that catches your interest, poke around the site a little bit and find out more about the options that fit your situation.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">After reviewing options to <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/options-that-reduce-your-debt-quickly/">reduce your debt</a>, be sure to check out these tips on <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/lowering-interest-rates-for-debt-reduction/">getting a lower interest rate</a> and <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/3-ways-to-get-lower-credit-card-payments/">lower monthly payments</a> on your debt. Lowering your interest rate is a great way to get out of debt much faster and to save lots and lots of money.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 12px; display: block; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Avoid Scams</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">When looking for help with your debt, it is important to be very cautious and to avoid being ripped off. Many companies make great promises that will get you really excited, but often these companies will simply take your money and leave you worse off.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">If you are looking into an option such as debt settlement, be sure that you understand what you are getting into, and read up on the <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/reducing-debt-with-debt-settlement/">pros and cons of debt settlement</a>. Many consumers have found themselves worse off after working with <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/do-credit-card-debt-negotiation-services-really-work/">credit card debt negotiation</a> services.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 12px; display: block; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Credit Counseling and Debt Management</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">Another popular option for debt help is credit counseling. Credit counselor can put you on a debt management plan that has the potential to be very helpful to certain consumers.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">Still, choosing the wrong credit counseling agency can be potentially disastrous for many people. Some can also be quite expensive, while others have very reasonable fees.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 10px;">Debt management through credit counseling, like any other <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/debt-reduction-plans-a-plan-that-works/">debt reduction plan</a>, is not a one size fits all solution. It can be the perfect answer for some people, but it can be totally wrong for others. It is important to know what the best option for your situation is.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 12px; display: block; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Let Us Help You</h3>

			<div class="entry">

					<p>We’ve all heard of the 7 deadly sins –Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Pride, Wrath, Envy and Sloth; but did you know they can be applied to your financial situation? Almost everyone who is struggling with <a href="http://www.moneysupermarket.com/debt/">debt</a> can blame their problems on at least one of the above behaviours.</p>
<p>Greed, also known as Avarice, is the compulsion to accumulate more than you need. A sin of excess, Greed is characterised by hoarding or seeking out ways to gain material wealth. In debt terms, this can be seen in people who hold several credit cards, or regularly go on shopping sprees to buy things they don’t need, for the sheer love of spending money. It’s a damaging behaviour, and usually results in large amounts of credit card debt which, as we all know, can take years to clear if you only make minimum payments each month. <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/the-7-deadly-debt-sins/#more-180" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

			<div class="entry">

					<p>Recently, it seems that my inbox has been full with one question even more often than usual.  Many of you who are working to<a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/"> reduce debt</a> are seeing, hearing, or reading the advertisements and wondering if debt negotiation services could help you get out of debt.</p>
<p>I have already talked about <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/do-credit-card-debt-negotiation-services-really-work/">credit card debt negotiation</a> and addressed <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/reducing-debt-with-debt-settlement/">debt settlement pros and cons</a> in a couple of articles.  Still, it seems that the bombardment of ads have made many of you curious about just what these services do, and whether or not they can help you out with your debt.</p>
<p>As we have stated many times here, we believe that a debt negotiation service is rarely, if ever, a good option to help you get out of debt.  In fact, in most cases, these companies can leave you in even worse shape than you were originally.   <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/can-debt-negotiation-services-help/#more-176" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>If you are drowning in debt and want to desperately free yourself from it, its time to pay off your debt. It is possible for you to <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/">reduce debt</a> and lead a debt-free life. This article helps you to know how to clear your debt on your own as well as with professional help.</p>
<p><strong>How to <a href="http://www.debtconsolidationcare.com/">pay off debt</a> on your own</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List how much you owe</strong> &#8211; Have a clear idea of your outstanding debt. Note down the names of your creditors, the amount you owe and the interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Pay the maximum</strong> &#8211; Paying more than minimum slashes the time that will take you to clear your debt. The longer you take to pay off, the more interest you have to pay.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t increase your debt</strong> &#8211; Use only one credit card and cut all other credit cards. Make it a habit to just spend on your basic needs.</li>
<li><strong>Take up a second job</strong> &#8211; Do a part-time job and use this extra salary to pay off more debt. <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/get-out-of-debt-on-your-own-or-take-professional-help/#more-168" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></li>

			<div class="entry">

					<p>One question that I hear fairly often these days is whether or not credit card <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/can-debt-negotiation-services-help/">debt negotiation services</a> can really help people get out of debt.  Most of the people who ask me this usually have no idea what terms like <a href="http://www.debtorsunite.com/Articles/Debt-Settlement/Debt-Negotiation.aspx">debt negotiation</a>, settlement, or debt relief mean or how these programs and services work.  Chances are you have come across some ad or another promising to help you get out of debt, and you&#8217;re wondering if you can really negotiate or <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/">reduce your debt</a> that you owe.</p>
<p>It actually is possible in some cases to negotiate the balance on the debt you owe.  This is actually the same as settling your debt, and if it is  something that you are considering you should carefully research the pros and cons.  There are many not so obvious <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/reducing-debt-with-debt-settlement/">debt settlement pros and cons</a> that most people are not fully aware of.   <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/do-credit-card-debt-negotiation-services-really-work/#more-150" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>While we have hosted many other great carnivals in the past, this week at <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/">Reduce Debt Faster</a> we are extremely proud to host the <a href="http://www.bestofmoneycarnival.com/">Best of Money Carnival</a>.  If you have not heard of this carnival, then you are certainly in for a treat.  The best of money carnival is one of the most exclusive, highest quality personal finance blog carnivals around.  Best of Money receives tons of great submissions every week, and only the 10 best personal finance articles are selected.</p>
<p>Choosing the best ten articles for this week was incredibly difficult.  There were so many great submissions and I literally spent hours reading great articles and new blogs about finance, insurance, debt, investing and everything related to money and personal finance.  It was tough to narrow this list down to ten, but here is the winner followed by the rest of the best of the best, in no particular order. <a href="http://www.reducedebtfaster.com/best-of-money-carnival-reduce-debt-faster-style/#more-140" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>
