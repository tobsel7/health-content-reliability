																<div class='box'><h2>What You Should Know</h2>
<p>P90X is a weight loss system created by Beach Body, a company that offers other weight reduction programs such as Hip Hop Abs and Turbo Jam. This system claims to get your body from &#8220;regular to ripped in just 90 days.&#8221; P90X consists of 12 workout routines (a series of DVDs), a 3-phase nutrition plan, unique supplement options, a fitness guide, a progress calendar and online support. Tony Horton is the &#8220;personal trainer&#8221; for this specific weight loss program. There is a 100% 90-day satisfaction guarantee offered with P90X. <p> <a href="http://www.dietspotlight.com/avesil-review/" rel="nofollow"> Continue Your Weight Loss Research: See Our Featured Diet For 2010. </a> </p></p>
<p>The key to this program&#8217;s effectiveness is stated to be &#8220;muscle confusion,&#8221; which basically means that numerous exercises are incorporated and encouraged to keep different muscle groups doing different things as much as possible. This way there is no &#8220;plateau&#8221; effect. Therefore the muscles do not get used to the routines and they continue to develop.  With a full workout plan, the money-back guarantee and a diet guide, P90X is one of the most comprehensive workout systems that we’ve seen offered.</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s Included:</b></p>
<p>The workout programs that come with P90X are named after the muscle groups that they work out, and these are: Chest and Back, Shoulders and Arms, Yoga X, Plyometrics, Legs and Back, Kenpo X, Chest, Shoulders and Triceps, Back and Biceps, Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Cardio X and X Stretch. There are success stories posted on the official P90X website. This fitness program is stated to take one hour each day. A few additional supplies needed for P90X are resistance bands or dumbbells and a pull-up bar/place to perform pull-ups.</p>
<p><b>For Enhanced Workout Results – A Thermogenic Supplement?</b></p>
<p>The exercises prescribed by P90X can definitely be strenuous, and the program makes no secret that its goal is to make exercisers “Bring it!” Many fitness enthusiasts have seen even more successful results with P90X by incorporating a thermogenic supplement into their workout routine. This stimulant effect can give a needed boost when it’s time to take it to the next level, while also ensuring that the body is burning fat before lean muscle. There are certainly many Thermogenics to choose from, and on this site, our top pick is the supplement Avesil. We were impressed that the manufacturers have posted clinical studies backing up their ingredients, and that they offer a risk free trial to perspective customers, so you can see if it helps before you buy. Click <a href="http://www.dietspotlight.com/store/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>here</b></a> to see the Trial details. Or click <a href="http://www.dietspotlight.com/avesil-review/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>here</b></a> to see what other readers have to say about Avesil.</p>
</div><div class="box" style="background:#ececec;"><h2>Product Features</h2>
<p>P90X is a very popular fitness program marketed toward men and women that aims to assist with losing unwanted body weight, toning up and &#8220;getting ripped.&#8221; This weight reduction system basically involves a series of DVDs that offer exercise routines, online support and a 3-phase nutritional plan. P90X is offered through the official website for three monthly installments of $39.95. This fitness program is offered with a 100 percent 90-day satisfaction guarantee. &#8220;Muscle confusion&#8221; is the primary focus of P90X, which addresses the notion of confusing the muscles with a number of different exercises so that none “plateau.” This supposedly leads to a stronger, slimmer and more fit physique. </p>
</div><div class='box'><h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>P90X can be easily and conveniently purchased through the official website.</li>
<li>P90X appears to be very popular with users.
	</li>
<li>P90X is offered with a 100%, 90-day satisfaction guarantee.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class='box'><h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>By all accounts, P90X is quite strenuous and the exercises may not be suitable for those who are severely overweight or for anyone with a pre-existing injury.</li>
<li>Some individuals may find that P90X is rather pricey since it involves three separate payments of $39.95 (totaling around $120).</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="box" style="background:#ececec;"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, the P90X weight loss program is interesting and quite intriguing in some respects. While it&#8217;s positive that the P90X system encourages regular exercise and a leaner diet, it&#8217;s tough to tell if this weight reduction program is really right for most individuals. In the end, P90X calls for a pretty heavy lifestyle change; not to mention a fairly high price tag for some users (around $120). If you have found that other exercise routines left you without results, there is no reason to believe that P90X is the answer. However, if you are up for a challenge this might be one worth looking into!</p>

		<p>After looking at hundreds of products, our top weight-loss choice is Avesil, which is offered through a Risk-Free Trial. Avesil is the most rigorously researched diet supplement we have encountered. The foundation behind Avesil is an original, scientific research study that incorporates an incredible 284 previously published peer-reviewed clinical studies, with many conducted in University research labs. Avesil is a safe, healthy way to promote a significant increase in weight loss when combined with healthy diet and exercise. In fact, many users see up to 3X the results they would without Avesil - it's all offered through an easy, Risk-Free Trial offer, leaving customers with nothing to lose (other than weight). >> <a href="http://www.dietspotlight.com/p90x-review/avesil-review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Read more about Avesil <img src="http://www.dietspotlight.com/img/round_arrow.gif" alt="Go"/></a></p>

In a clinical trial done with Flex Belt 100% of participants measured results in flattening, toning, and strengthening the stomach. Flex Belt isn't a gimmick- it's 100% medical science. It's the first EMS (Electric Muscle Stimulation) device of its kind cleared by the FDA as a Class II Medical Device for direct to consumer sales.

I purchased P90X for myself. I hadn&#8217;t worked out in over a year. Even though the workouts are tough, because each day you will work out to muscle failure, there are 3 versions of each exercise that is done throughout the videos. So even if you can&#8217;t do a close hand pushup, maybe you can do the close hand pushup while on your knees. It is worth the money. And you will not regret it!!</p>

I still can&#8217;t do a chin up, plough position or a Dreya Roll, but with resistance bands and half exercise, I still feel teh effects.</p>
<p>Only negative is that now I have elbow pain in my left elbow (tendonitis?) when I do push ups or get in the downward dog position. Until it goes away, I&#8217;ve been doing the push ups by getting in a push up position with my forearms on a solid chair and I still feel the burn in my gut without the pain in the elbow.</p>

These workouts are intense.  When going to the gym regularly I was almost never sore &#8211; Now I am sore most of the time.  A GOOD SORE!  My muscles and core feel tighter and I can feel them getting leaner and stronger.  Truth be told, I skip Yoga and replace it with Core Synergistics &#8211; and I realize it is ok to skip a day if need be &#8211; at 43 with a family it is hard to commit to everyday.  I am also training for a 1/2 marathon, so I have to fit that in as well.  Bottom line &#8211; this is a great system where you just follow orders and let your body do the rest.

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing P90X now for 6 months and I can tell you that the most difficult part is the first few weeks which will nearly kill you and it will take about a month for you to really start feeling and seeing the results.</p>
<p>If you stick with this and make it a part of your daily routine as I have, you will be successful. </p>
<p>I feel and look better today at 49 than I did at 25. I was already in very good cardio condition as I&#8217;ve been a distance runner for years but I did not have the &#8220;fit physique&#8221; that I wanted. </p>
<p>The very first workout caused me to throw-up as I had zero upper body strength. My pull-up count was zero, and push-ups were 6.  Today  pound-out 20 pull-ups and 60 push-ups in my workouts and I have the upper body conditioning that I&#8217;ve always wanted. </p>
<p>The net/net is that I suspect that P90X has one of the highest drop-out rates imaginable-not because it does not work (it does), but because it&#8217;s hard and takes dedication and discipline.</p>
<p>Do it and you wont regret it.</p>

I am 48 years old and bought the P90X Program. It is a really good program and not a waste of money,but like anything else it only works if you do the work. There is a fitness test included with the program to make sure you are in good enough shape, if not you can take it at a slower pace. Maybe have your Dr give you a check and OK it. I hope this helps.</p>

The program is misunderstood in the fact that in the book, materials and dvd&#8217;s it tells everyone to take breaks when needed, work at your own pace, and set PERSONAL goals in each exercise so you have a baseline to try to achieve or excel above the next time the exercise is performed.

				<p>I have been doing P90X for the last 14 months.  Previously I ran 5 miles per day for many years.  I feel better now than I ever did while just running.  I purchased the P90X package, additional pull up bars and increasing dumbell weights as I progressed through the program.  It is money well spent.  My cholesterol numbers are well within the normal range now and I feel fantastic.  I made small adjustments to my diet, nothing drastic.  Try it for 90 days, you&#8217;ll be hooked after the first couple of workouts.</p>

				<p>Any form of exercise that gets people moving is a plus in my opinion.</p>
<p>One warning: you have to be in fairly good shape before you begin this program to see the &#8220;ripped&#8221; results they talk about in their infomercials.If you can&#8217;t pass their fit test then this program is not for you. Obese and severely obese people will have issues performing allot of the exercises. My tip is to lose weight so that you are close to your maximum BMI, then try this program.</p>
<p>You really don&#8217;t any suppliments for this program, although I highly recommend taking a post recovery drink after everywork out. This will help you with muscle soreness and give you that extra edge.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of pounding back beer, burgers and pizza &#8211; you&#8217;re wasting your time with any fitness program. You have to eat right to see results.</p>
<p>The nicest thing about this program is that there is no geuss work involved and the program lays everything out for you in an easy to follow guide. &#8211; And Tony is a great motivator. All Tony asks, is that you &#8220;Bring It!&#8221;</p>

I decided to start with Power 90 instead, then after finishing that program move on to P90X. I&#8217;m one week into Power 90 and am having great results, lost 7 lbs and feeling better than I have in years!!<br />
So I agree, those in poor shape, beware! Start slow, then move on when ready.</p>

				<p>I am a Marine Corps Veteran. As a kid, I swam as a sport. I was really good and took many meets and won many a trophy. I swam 20,000 yards a day 6 days a week. I ate what I wanted and never lost weight, but I didn&#8217;t gain either. I was six foot and 156 until my senior year. Then i bulked up to 176. I was in great shape. I actually wore out my drill instructors. When i got out, i became a restaurant manager, and i never had the time for the gym or the pool. I was at 266 lbs. Then i gave this a call. This system of P-90x is amazing. It is the closest thing to what I used to do for strength training. I don&#8217;t have to drive anywhere. I borrowed my dad&#8217;s old dumbbells, and i went to town. It&#8217;s been 45 days and I&#8217;m back to 220lbs and my handles and belly are gone. My muscles are getting nice! My wife loves it! This system really works! My wife even started doing it and she seems impressed.</p>

I am in very good shape, but am looking for a change. So, today I ordered! Can&#8217;t wait. One question, what happens after the 90 days? Does the program give you recommendations to keep going or do you start it over? That&#8217;s the only question I can not find any answers to.<br />
Let me know if you have a chance. THANKS!</p>

				<p>I love this program. I hit a weight loss plateau after dropping 43 pounds. This program successfully helped me break through it to my leanest weight in close to 5 or 6 years! If you stay committed and overall just eat healthier and cut out the unnecessary fats and sweets you WILL lose weight. I&#8217;m not ripped like the people in the video, but I can keep up. Everyday I&#8217;ve lost some weight. You can buy this off of amazon considerably cheaper than beach body&#8217;s price. If you have the time and committment, BRING IT!</p>

At 25 I had back surgery for 2 herniated discs.  For years I was scared to do anything because I was afraid of hurting my back again.  As a result, I put on some pounds.  I actually bought P90X for my son for Christmas a couple of years ago and I started doing it with him.  If you have previous injuries then you have to listen to your body and just do your best.  Tony encourages you to take breaks if you need them or to modify moves.  There are still moves that I struggle with and there are times when my back says, “Not today!”  But those days are fewer now than what they were.  Rebuilding my strength in my lower back has helped me relieve a lot of back pain.<br />
This program is hard but you control the intensity.  Just increase your intensity as you develop more strength without overdoing it.  As Tony says, “Do your best and forget the rest.”  If you take it serious, this will be one purchase you never regret.</p>

				<p>I notice there are a lot of review pages for this and other programs.  Most pages are being promoted by the maker of the product, or someone selling the product.  Real bunch of winners.  I&#8217;ll give an honest review that&#8217;s unbiased, since I have no vested interest in selling anything, as I am a working professional not working in the field of fitness at the present moment.  I used to be an accomplished personal trainer for many years.  But that was long ago in a galaxy far away.  So let&#8217;s begin:</p>
<p>I think it sucks! Tony is full of crap. The same goes for the Insanity workout, the Hip Hop Abs CD, and most of the other stupid workout videos. The workouts are dangerous (the exercises are fast, sloppy, and ballistic), and just because you change the exercises (in P90X), doesn’t mean you have enough intensity to make changes. Intensity (loose definition: is some how performing more work than you did last time). And even if you have enough intensity, which is hard to do if you don’t know what it means, then you can easily get injured by performing new exercises without learning good form. There is a learning curve for form everytime you learn a new exercise, and if you rush it, sorry, you get injured. A week or two, or even three is not enough time. So so sorry. The good news is: Anyone can lose weight on a well balanced maintainence calorie diet (the Zone is a good start), and then, working out with weights hard (and I mean hard. no “girly” weights. that goes for women too!!!) 30 minutes 2x a week, HIIT cardio training once a week, low intensity arobics 3x a week for an hour, and having good enough form not to get injuried (something this program can’t guarantee, sorry. You need a workout form coach to actually see you in motion to correct the mistakes. And it can’t be done in a video. Who’s watching you? God. He better be, because with the injuries you are going to incure, you better be praying). Anyway Tony, and the rest of the gang, you are either very unethical, or very very stupid. Either way the program is a bunch of crap. Stick to the basics, and learn good form from somebody who knows what good form is in real time, not on a CD. Don’t be cheap, it’s your health we’re talking about. You don’t need a trainer forever. Just a few workouts to learn good safe form. What you don’t need, is just another hyped up bullshit program with actors getting paid to say whatever. I give the lowest rating to this program for being totally unethical or stupid or both. Any questions?</p>
<p>And about the issue of exercise boredom: I’m an MSN, and trust me, I know it’s &#8220;real fun&#8221; and not boring when you have a chronic injury and are laid up at home, or even worse, in the hospital after surgery. Yeah, real real fun. I repeat, stick to the basics. Nobody said the basics were that fun. They are what they are, and it is what it is. Only a few hours a week, but the pay off is great.<br />
Then maybe, when your in decent shape, understand about what is safe form, and have decent flexibility, then for variety, you can proceed forward and use these programs with extreme caution.</p>

I&#8217;m a college athlete and always have been in good shape, but after having a baby and worked out all thru the pregnancy I went to a trainer and it was ridiculous I couldn&#8217;t walk for a week, fell down the stairs with my baby in my arms and thought I was going to die. Told her about it and still tried to kill me the next week.  My thought on a lot of trainers is that they want to try and kill you for their pleasure of watching, but they never participate in the excercises with you, so they really don&#8217;t know what they are putting you through. Cuz really can&#8217;t you go online and become a TRAINER?????  </p>
<p>By the way, have you tried the P90X?  I think what it&#8217;s saying is enter at your own risk.  Most people do this at the gym anyway, they don&#8217;t know what the hell they are doing and do it anyway, so why not watch a video and get a little help on FORM without hiring an egostical ASS at the gym to help kill you!!!!  Just my opinion!!!!</p>

I woke up sore everyday&#8230;not because I was injured but because I was working my ass off. You obviously never tried this system or you would know that Tony is not tring to injure anyone.

We are really excited and have gotten the chance to see previews of the dvds and they seem like a lot of fun. </p>
<p>I understand the injury warnings, but like becky said, that goes for the gym, trainer or any workout. I like this program because Tony constantly says to do your best and to always modify the exercises when needed. I think programs like this are for people who want to fit workout routines into their daily life schedules, get motivated, have someone give advice without costing too much, and have fun while getting into tip-top shape! </p>
<p>I also saw some reviews and sometimes this program goes past the 90 days for people, but it all depends on the person (weight, genetics, gender, health&#8230;etc) but they still got amazing results! So if it takes 120 days for the results that you were looking for, you shouldn&#8217;t get discouraged. Also, you might even gain some weight during exercises, because remember you are gaining muscle and also during recovery time, your body is healing which means you could take on some water weight during this time. </p>
<p>Any workout plan is about setting goals for yourself and to keep building onto your goals. I just think, for me, workout dvds are helpful. I was on a crew team in high school and loved the motivation I got from my coaches, I think Tony can do that for me and my husband! Plus, all you really need are resistance bands and weights (my husband and I are going to get a chin-up bar, but it&#8217;s not horrible if you don&#8217;t), and your body performs a lot of the resistance during these workouts as well!!</p>
<p>Hope this helps!! X</p>

The proof comes with finishing the program.  I am 46 years old (my name comes with an M.D.,FACEP, so I know a little about health).  I went from 23% body fat to 11% in three months.  I am in better shape than I have been in years.  Injury can and does occur in any sport.  The disclaimers preceding  each workout are clear. You better be in good shape before starting this program. I certainly don&#8217;t need an overpriced (or blow-hard) trainer to be able to figure it out.  If you had bothered to try the program or at least watched the DVD&#8217;s you would know that the participants are not actors or professional athletes.  Think what you want, this program WORKS.</p>

I am 30 years old, a mother of 2 and about 70 lbs overweight. I have been walking/running for about 8 weeks now and have lost 20lbs, I feel like I am ready for this.

				<p>P90X is GREAT. 40+ Mom of two speaking. For Michael, why dig at those who are happy to show results ? It&#8217;s worked for them. Agree with Becky in that fitness experts overlook form AND that Tony&#8217;s workout&#8217;s DO show correct form. It&#8217;s up to us to check our&#8217;s which we could do with a mirror or buddy. GO FOR IT, people &#8211; if you&#8217;ve a lot of weight to lose then start off slowly, learn good form, then do another round after your 90-days. FANTASTIC set of work-outs; warm-ups, warm-downs and stretches taken care of &#8211; you&#8217;re not just thrown into the deep end.</p>

				<p>I should start this by saying I haven&#8217;t used the P90X program. On the surface it looks like it would be a killer program for those who are already dedicated to exercise and fitness. However, I can&#8217;t see how someone like me (who is very busy and lives quite a hectic life) would stay with such a program. It looks awfully complicated and time consuming. Even if the exercises aren&#8217;t time consuming, there&#8217;s got to be a lot of prep work (looking at the DVDs for proper form, etc). Just watching the commercial makes me not want to exercise. I&#8217;m afraid that these multiple DVD programs aren&#8217;t for the average person and the key to staying with a fitness program is something that&#8217;s quick and uncomplicated, but still shows results so you want to do it the next day. As such, I&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ll stick with my routine of alternating cardio with a quick isometric and dynamic tension workout.</p>

<p>You sound like you have given up before you even get started. Remember, P90X like most DVD exercises can be done at your own pace, however, if you convince yourself that it is too hard then it probably is, but remember this, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart conditions do not care about your busy hectic life, they will attact regardless.If you care anything about your health, you MUST find the time to exercise, no exceptions.</p>

				<p>We just started the P90x program yesterday and it is tough. We are finding it is better to do it together to have somebody to push you. Our kids are also trying some of the routines. I would not reccomend this if you are extremely out of shape. It is hard. Not for the lazy and unmotivated.</p>

				<p>We were looking at the equipment offered by P90x, the Pull-Up bar, Push up handles and the bands. It is pretty expensive. We found a great alternative offered by gold&#8217;s gym that has everything for 49.99 at Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods. We also found a great substitute for the recovery drink. We found it at Vitamin World and it is called Endurox R4. It has pretty much the same ingredients.</p>

				<p>Im 51 5&#8242;2&#8243; female weigh 127lbs<br />
I started p90x 3 weeks ago and I love it. Im doing it to get in shape for my daughters wedding. There is no short cut to being healhty. Yeah sure it cost $120.00 but pills cost money over and over and you usually gain the weuight when you stop taking them. This is a lifestyle change. I make my meat on the weekends and freeze it then just pack it along with me to work. If you are motivated you can do and they tell you the diet will be the hardest part. I get plenty to eat so Im am never starving. I have started to see the resluts with get a little slimmer and getting the muscle def I want. My endurance is also getting stronger. I love this program and find it easier that anything Ive ever done. Is it easy? No way I just meant it fits into my life. I love it ! I say go for it and I&#8217;ll see you in 60 more days!</p>

				<p>You sound like you have given up before you even get started. Remember, P90X like most DVD exercises can be done at your own pace, however, if you convince yourself that it is too hard then it probably is, but remember this, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart conditions do not care about your busy hectic life, they will attack regardless.If you care anything about your health, you MUST find the time to exercise, no exceptions.</p>

The trick is to use a weight where you max out at 8-10 reps, the last 2 or 3 reps should be super hard.  If you can do more than 10 reps, get a higher weight.  Also, protein, Protein, PROTEIN!  follow the plan, but add an extra protein shake or 2, goes great with a meal.</p>

I&#8217;m a regular gym rat and lets just say, I&#8217;ve been more exhausted from P90x and added about 20 lbs to my bench already.<br />
My only criticism is that the leg portion doesn&#8217;t help me as much as doing squats, deadlifts, etc. However, the upper body portion of the program is gold.<br />
hope that helps. I drink Gold Standard Egg Protein (cause whey isolate f**ks my stomach up) and I eat Cliff bars (has fat to gain some mass). NOTE -you won&#8217;t ever gain mass without some fat, hence cliff bars. I&#8217;m getting pretty strong and confidence is soaring</p>

A pull up bar would be nice since you&#8217;re already working hard to begin with, but it&#8217;s something that I think you can work in to.  If you rig a hook somewhere high in your home (ceiling or near the top of a wall), and loop your resistance bands around that loop, it will substitute for the pull up bar if you apply enough resistance by moving your butt back far enough.  Everything else can be done w/o weights, just make sure that you have enough resistance when you do start to get stronger (and you will, i sure did)</p>

				<p>			
				<p>First off: I&#8217;m seeing a bunch of comments like &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost 17 lbs in 3 weeks&#8221;.  Most of the numbers people give are inflated and not taking into account the vast amounts of water weight lost.  When someone says they lost 17lbs, it usually equates to about 5lbs of fat and 12lbs of water.</p>
<p>Second: Yes, this program will work for almost anyone who is willing to put in the effort &#8211; that&#8217;s obvious.  But why pay for this?  You can do a little research and develop your own routine (tailored to yourself).  There are plenty of informative websites out there.  The best ones are usually NOT trying to sell you something every few sentences.  How to eat is not rocket science either.  You don&#8217;t need to take out the credit card for generic routines that are made for the masses and for profit alone.</p>
<p>Just as you supposedly are going to put a lot of effort into working out, why can&#8217;t you simply put effort into gaining knowledge about what you&#8217;re doing?  It&#8217;s amazing how little people know about diet and exercise.  Companies are thriving because of your ignorance.  This really isn&#8217;t acceptable in the internet age.  Quit being lazy.</p>

It is more of an intermediate to advanced program.  If you are very dedicated though, you can probably give it a try with the modified exercises.  Just don&#8217;t get discouraged early!  It&#8217;s difficult even for thing individuals.  If it&#8217;s too difficult, try one of the other easier programs until you&#8217;ve lost some weight (down to about 180) and then switch back to P90X.  P90X&#8217; biggest benefits weight-loss-wise is probably its eating plan coupled with daily challenging exercise.  Any healthy eating plan coupled with consistent challenging exercise should help you get the weight down if you stick with it.</p>

I have lost 10 lbs and several inches from my wait already and I know that in time I will find that I will be able to do more and more.  Give it a try and bring your &#8220;bring it&#8221; attitude.

I lost most of my &#8220;water weight&#8221; then so that my p90x results does not include those lbs. Having said that, Tavia is right. You will have some moves that you cannot do all the way and will have to modify. BUT, keep moving! Modify the moves and feel the burn. Get a heart rate monitor&#8230;it is encouraging to see how many calories you are burning.  I also lowered the amt of calories I was taking in because I know 1800 is too much for me. but dont drop too low (ie lower than 1400)! You will get better and better everytime you do an exercise and you will surprise yourself! Just keep it up&#8230;.think of it this way&#8230;you are changing the way you eat to a healthy plan and working out everyday (even if you cant keep up the first few times)&#8230;it is a ton better for you than what you were doing&#8230;so it cant hurt and it will help you!</p>

				<p>ok i just started the workout iam 5&#8242;3 120lbs. i eat whatever i want in proper portions, a few small meals through out the day,cuz im always on the run. I choose cereal bars, fruit and nuts when im on the go. I lost 20lbs in high school by exercising for 1/2 hr everyday for 4 months.So i do know a good something about weight loss. I kept the weight off for 7 years and im still in shape. P90x obviously works! its common sense! especially when your working out that intensely. I&#8217;ll admit it i have to take tiny breaks on it like every 7 mins(keep in mind i smoke and have asthma) but thats okay cuz im just starting it. I dont intend on doing it in the correct order or buying supplements. I know for a fact that it will still improve my health. An hour of p90x a day can only give benefits!!  For all you people who doubt it, then DO IT and let me know how you feel after just 30 days.  After 90 you arent done however, you will have knowledge and experience on how to get and stay fit. Its a lifelong process. and it gets easier <img src='http://www.dietspotlight.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<p>Ok for those of you asking the same questions  here are some of the facts.. The P90 series is very good. but as we all know that you get what you put into your workout.  Yes you can do all the exercises and not really puch yourself and loose wieght, The diet plan is very basic and yes it works. This diet gives you a good base for starting and long lasting diet regiment.  And for those For those of you who want to BULK up, this program will work for you in higher volume and adding mass amount of protien and vitamins to your diet.. Those of you that are like my self and were bigger than normal people, and wants to look ripper , do not try yo get bulked up and expect to loose weight it will not work.. To get that ripped look you have to cut the weight THEN bulk up slowly. ( AKA creatine not good). so enjoy your workouts and stay the course.</p>

				<p>wrapping up P90X next week (week 13?). this program WORKS. i am 5&#8242;10&#8243;, currently 163lb. i lost 10lbs during the program and have gained much muscle mass. my abs looks great, i FEEL great, and i am extending the program an extra 30 days (120 total). Tony Horton is an amazing trainer and the routines are engaging.<br />
Note that P90X requires a lot of time and dedication. i wake up at 5:45am every morning to get through the workouts and make it to work by 8am. i have followed the diet plan, worked hard, and can happily say that i&#8217;ve seen tremendous results.<br />
Just press play and BRING IT!</p>

				<p>I am 19 about 6&#8242;1 240 lbs ex highschool football player haven&#8217;t worked out hard in about 6 months I&#8217;m not fat but definitely over weight by about 20lbs so far I am on day 3 and love it i&#8217;m doing the classic version and follow my own nutrition plan and I won&#8217;t lie I am sore and hurt just about all day but having played sports and worked out hard before I know that will go away soon enough it is a great program very intense but fun so far stick with it I plan to if you do I&#8217;m sure you will see results you may not get ripped like them but within a year if you keep at it and incorporate some gym time I can see this really working it&#8217;s a great leap in the right direction for anyone who wants to be healthier if your young like me try not to go out to bars and drink so much if you cut out beer and other liquors you won&#8217;t be as sore because alcohol is terrible for muscle growth and repair Bring it!</p>

				<p>Does anyone know how long one should wait after delivering a baby (C-section)?  Plus because I had a high risk complicated pregnancy I was told to avoid any activities throughout my 9 months of pregnancy.  Prior to that I was an average fit 115 lb/5 ft 3 woman (mainly walking and chasing after a 2 year old).  </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

				<p>My husband and I just started P90X a little over a week ago and I have to say that I love it! I&#8217;ve already lost 8 lbs. Yesterday morning I got on the scale and had lost 2 lbs. since the morning before. The cutting back on the calories and eating healthy and this exercise is really kicking my weight loss in. I had been doing Denise Austin&#8217;s &#8220;Fit and Lite&#8221; and &#8220;Daily Workout&#8221; and P90X is definitely on a whole other level.  I&#8217;m going to be 50 years old this year and gained a bit of weight over the winter and have 20 lbs. to lose to get back to my size 6/8 and we are doing the &#8220;lean&#8221; routine. I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge and have only had to push the &#8220;pause&#8221; button so I could get my heart rate down a little a few times during some of the tapes.  I really thought this was going to be way too hard for me and just for the guys, but I was surprised that I am keeping up with them and sometimes go faster than they do!  It could be that I love it so much because I was already used to doing plyometrics, the kickboxing, yoga/pilates, etc.  I&#8217;m very comfortable and already know most of the moves he does on these tapes so I&#8217;m really enjoying it and feel like it was made for me. I can&#8217;t do but maybe 4 or 5 pushups because of a shoulder injury so I&#8217;ll do plank position to work my abs or another exercise instead. It&#8217;s only been almost two weeks and I&#8217;m already fitting into clothes that were too snug before and can feel my body tightening and becoming firmer. I&#8217;ve gotten into bikini shape with Denise Austin tapes but I have a feeling that the P90X tapes are going to get me into the best shape I&#8217;ve ever been in and faster than it took me before. My husband really likes it too.  He&#8217;s having to get used to the fact that he&#8217;s not that flexible so the yoga and pilates are hard for him but I told him it would get better and not feel so awkward as time goes on.  So all in all we are very excited about this program and feel like we can continue it for years to come.</p>

				<p>If you are clearly overweight, and you want to slim down, protein drinks are not for you. go with the lean version and try your best to modify what you can and cant do. if you are severely overweight protein shakes will just add more weight to you.</p>

				<p>Hey evreyone, i was looking into ordering the program but have a question. Is this program just for people who want to lose weight? Im one of those that CANT gain weight. Ive tried shakes and stuff which didnt really work for me. Ive decided to just try and mayb tone up or &#8220;get ripped&#8221; with what i got instead of trying to gain weight. Would this be a good program? I&#8217;m 6&#8242;1, 155lbs. I&#8217;m just really self conscious about being thin and wana do something about it.</p>

It is *extremely* customizable &#8211; there are ways to make P90X for weight loss, for overall fitness, for toning, for strength.  </p>

				<p>Hey everyone. I&#8217;ve seen the infomercials. I&#8217;ve read some of the comments and testimonials of p90x. I&#8217;m stoked to try it. However, I have a question to ask of you all. I&#8217;m 22yrs of age, 5&#8242;7&#8243;, weigh 185lbs, 11% body fat, and haven&#8217;t hit the gym in a couple years. I would like to think that I could do this program and not get discouraged in any way. How soon would it be, in your opinion, for someone like myself to see results? Also, I would like to get down to 4% body fat. If not, then i&#8217;d accept 6%. Is this goal possible with this program? Any advice??</p>

				<p>I would definitely recommend getting this if: 1) you are ready to make a lifestyle change and can commit yourself to the diet (warning &#8211; it is expensive and not convenient and usually nobody is going to be there to tell you not to eat that easy cheeseburger or chocolate bar) and 2) you can find 1 1/2 hours every day for 6 days a week to workout (and this is the extreme use of the word workout).  If you don&#8217;t have it alreay, you will need to purchase weights (I have a set of the Bowflex SelectTech weights and they are fantastic) or resitance bands, a pullup bar, a yogo mat (highly recommended) and a heart rate monitor &#8211; I probably spent close to $800 for the DVD&#8217;s and all of this gear, but it will be money well spent and will save me money in the future (the program can be done with cheaper equipment &#8211; expect at least $300 if you are a bargain hunter or buy 2nd-hand stuff off Ebay).</p>
<p>I have just finished my first week and I will admit that it kicked my butt pretty good for the first 4 days.  I think my body is now starting to get used to being worked and I don&#8217;t feel as sore after the workouts.  Just be prepared, if you aren&#8217;t already in great shape, that you will need to go through this adjustment period and that it will be hell.  It is only temporary though and if you truly want it then you will find a way to push through.  I also guarantee there will be a few DVD&#8217;s you will despise, but those are also the ones you should save more &#8220;Bring It&#8221; for because that is likely your biggest weakness (I love to hate YogaX and Ab RipperX).</p>
<p>Anyway, it is not for everyone &#8211; I am definitely not the ideal candidate myself and will need many more weeks of strengthening and conditioning to be able to do everything correctly.  Hopefully if you choose to take the challenge you stick with it and get the great results that are possible for all of us.</p>

				<p>I just thought I&#8217;d throw my two cents in&#8230;</p>
<p>Love love love P90X!!!  I can&#8217;t stand exercising, don&#8217;t like to sweat, and can&#8217;t do a pullup to save my life!  Honestly, I&#8217;d rather be on a patio having a cocktail&#8230;</p>
<p>Having said that, this is the only exercise program that I actually WANTED to stick with.  It&#8217;s really a lot of fun, and Tony is quite entertaining, in a corny way <img src='http://www.dietspotlight.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />   Within the first month I went from a size 10 to a 6.  It definitely wasn&#8217;t easy, but if you can make it through the first week, it gets better.  The diet plan is pretty easy to follow, and I was eating way more than I was used to.  As a restaurant manager, it was hard to stick with the diet completely, because you eat at crazy times, and you learn to live on one meal a day and random snacking.  Regardless, I still lost the size and even got to partake in wine now and then (something I&#8217;m just not willing to give up!).<br />
Overall, it&#8217;s totally worth it, and if I can give any advise to those who are considering, STICK WITH IT!!!  You will get results!</p>
<p>**I am 29 and in relatively good health (if anyone&#8217;s wondering)</p>

				<p>When I got the P90X DVD&#8217;s, I reviewed each one of them to see what each exercise was like. I thought I should be able to do this. When I saw the man with one leg doing this, I thought, ;if he can, I can.&#8221; I&#8217;m on week 10, day 4 (yoga) of the first phase. I plan to do another one.<br />
For those who are questioning about purchasing this, purchase it. Modify when needed; I use the pull up bar as a push up bar (turn it up-side down) and it seems to work well since I have CTS and it is less stress on my wrists, plus the hand placement width can still be varied.<br />
(One really good piece of advise: If you order, or purchase, the pull-up bar and it comes with the two &#8220;sort&#8217;a &#8216;L-shaped&#8217;&#8221; brackets, INSTALL THEM. Your head, and butt, will thank you for that. Trust me, they will. Buy some brackets at a hardware store if you have too, but USE THEM).<br />
I have went from 235lbs to 212lbs, which I have seemed to maintain for the past two or so weeks. But, I&#8217;m satisfied with that. I brought it, brought it and brought it somemore. You can too.<br />
&#8220;Scissors, get it. I&#8217;m done talking; Five, four, threetwoone.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I started P90x 3 weeks ago, and when I started then, it was murder! I had to take a break like almost every minute! Its just so intense!  But now I&#8217;m taking less breaks and able to push myself.  It&#8217;s only been 3 weeks, but I&#8217;m slowly seeing results, I&#8217;m certain that this work, b/c my body aches like crazy all over after every workout!  Good luck everyone!</p>

				<p>			
				<p>Started p90x and have just finished my 5th week.  The question I have is I&#8217;m not losing any weight.  By the body fat calculations I&#8217;ve lost 5.5% body fat but I have gained 2 pounds.  A 6&#8242; 213 lbs, I feel I&#8217;m 15 to 20 pounds heavy.  Will the weight start to come off later in the program or should I think about a diet change.  I have been pretty strict about following the portion food plan but I have a hard time eating enough protein in a day.  I will usually get 5 to 6 servings a day but not the 8 the program calls for.  If I change, should I eat less or more?</p>

				<p>Alright so here it goes&#8230;I&#8217;m a male bout 5&#8243;11 216 lbs my my goal is to drop to 180-190. Two years ago I weighed 250 ya talk bout fatty but I ran lift weights and ate healthy for a college kid. Now previous to all that I always played sports any kind but never did sports in school I was in band hahaha. reason I&#8217;m sayin all this is to show u my background and prove that I&#8217;m not a spokesperson for beachbody . I worked out and ran bout 3 miles a day bout 5-6 days a week and drank 100 plus ounces of water on a daily basis while eating right as in eating complex carbs and meat high in protein low in crabs and fat. In any diet u never want to cut out or dramatically decrease your intake of fats or carbs. Always.have a high amount of protein tho anyways just ordered P90x and all I.have to say is dam lol in a good way started 4 days ago after first day ridiculously sore same with second and third. To solve this tho I eat high protein and drink a protein shake w creatine monohydrate to help build and repair my muscles. I have not followed the.nutrition plan I&#8217;m following my own based around theirs. In 4 days I&#8217;ve lost 1 lb. P90x will work if.you do.it.right and caution be sure u take the.fitness test before and pace yourself.</p>

				<p>Male, 32, 6&#8243;1, 198 lbs</p>
<p>Dedication, nutrition and 110% every workout.  These, with a little education, make any workout successful. </p>
<p>P90X is an excellent choice for anyone.  If you can&#8217;t get motivated to workout, have trouble getting to the gym, or you simply can&#8217;t piece together the nutrition puzzle.  I own it, I&#8217;ve done the 90 days and I must say the results are great if you put in the effort.  </p>
<p>If you make excuses, complain about a little soreness or pain or mentally defeat yourself by constantly saying &#8220;I&#8217;m too tired&#8221; then don&#8217;t waste your money.  No miracle diet, workout or drug will help you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally a gym junkie.. have been for years now.  P90x works if you put in the effort, but I find with the right training and muscle confusion at the gym I get results more towards what I&#8217;m looking for. Contra-lateral training, negative only, burnouts&#8230; I prefer the iPod and cold steel to the living room and television.</p>
<p>DEDICATION!!!  Never quit.  Never think your done.  Never say your too tired, sore, burned out.  Don&#8217;t play a mental game with yourself.  I still, after 6 years, find myself losing my lunch on occasion from putting in a little too much effort while I&#8217;m lifting.  </p>
<p>Stick to it for 90 days, don&#8217;t cheat even one Kit Kat bar.  When your done and see the difference you&#8217;ll be hooked and find a new lifestyle.  Friends and family will be impressed with your dedication and will power. More energy while your awake.  Better sleep.  The confidence boost makes all the difference in your life.  Treat your body like a temple and it will act as such.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget your multivitamins. Nick is right about protein.  The &#8220;golden hour&#8221; after a workout is the perfect time to consume a little protein to help repair your muscles.</p>

				<p>I started this program a week ago, and I haven&#8217;t even been doing it by their schedule&#8230;I&#8217;ve just been knocking out the hardest ones and eating healthy.<br />
I&#8217;ve lost 12 lbs in a week, dead serious. This workout, makes you feel amazing. One week, 12 pounds lighter, just the beginning, I&#8217;m loving it. You have to be determined,and give the workouts 110%&#8230;you can&#8217;t half ass it and expect to loose weight. Eat right, challenge yourself, and you&#8217;ll see the results everyones talking about.</p>

				<p>Great Workouts Horrible Customer Service.  I was given p90X as a gift.  When I played the Plyometrics DVD the first time, it errored and contains incomplete final 3 chapters.  Beachbody expects me to pay $18 for a replacement, due to the fact that I was given it as a gift.<br />
The more in contact I have been the more I feel as if Beachbody is a Scam. The main reason I feel this way is there is no unique identifier on any of their product, UPC etc.  The only unique number in my kit is the promotional code for discounts on the Beachbody website.  Even though they confirmed this number as accurate, Beachbody still denied that the product could be confirmed as theirs.  While I highly recommend the workouts, I would advise to be skeptical of Beachbody.</p>

				<p>plain and simple ladies and gents</p>
<p>all of you guys who are worried about being able to do it with a ________ injury will just have to give it a try to know if its going to work</p>
<p>the workouts are hard but<br />
you are shown easier ways to do them, the option of fewer reps, and more frequent brakes in between  </p>
<p>don&#8217;t let the fact that its hard keep you from being motivated</p>
<p>the workouts are really only as intense as you make them</p>
<p>if you dont have a pull up bar<br />
you can use elastic bands like they do in the video</p>
<p>IF YOUR NOT SURE ABOUT SPENDING 120$ CHECK CRAIGSLIST OR DOWNLOAD IT FOR FREE ONLINE SOMEWHERE<br />
hell im only 18 and got it without having to buy it</p>

Recommend it but you have to stick with the diet which isn&#8217;t so bad. I actualy eat 5-6x/day and never hungry.</p>

				<p>Purchased the 13 DVD set off Craigslist for $65 w/diet and workout booklet.  Started recently with my wife third day.  We&#8217;re forcing ourselves to go slow since we haven&#8217;t worked out in awhile.  Had a trainer for a couple of years and I&#8217;m getting similar results (soreness, muscle pump, heart rate, etc.)  Dealing with some Plantar fasciatis so I modify as necessary.  We&#8217;re currently running throught the week for the first time doing the exercises only once (the DVD usually does it twice) until we get our muscles acclimated.  Next week we&#8217;ll start our 90 day clock and do the full program or as much as we can do.  I&#8217;d recommend the bands for anyone who can&#8217;t go pullups.  They are also good for most of the exercises although I like dumbells.  Bands are easier to store also and cheaper.  Also the door chin up bar doesnt work well for me its too low even at my height of 6&#8242; and seems like it can barely hold my 240#.  We&#8217;re doing the diet plan also with some mods.  Wife loves the food, of course I&#8217;m cooking, and she&#8217;s pretty picky and doesn&#8217;t like fish.  Chicken with Honey Chile sauce and Island Pork are our favs.  Let you know how the weight and inches go in 30 days.</p>

				<p>I dont agree with the comment that P90x is expensive.  When you compare the P90x programme to Gym fees and travel costs and not to mention your own time when travelling to the gym.  To have this programme and not have any ongoing fees and the fact that it can be conducted in your own home, I dont think it is expensive at all.  I have been using this programme since Jan 10 and the results have been great.  I have not followed the nutrition part however the fitness alone has given me some good results.  For me it was not a weight loss, however it has resulted in definition and all round performance and strength.  Good to be back in shape as a result and not let the office job be an excuse for becoming a fat lump.</p>

I know, I know&#8230;people are scared of Torrents but lets face it, these guys already made millions off this thing selling it to the many people who should have never bought it in the first place, and the economy sucks.  Torrents are very safe, and they save you a ton of money.</p>
<p>As for the program (now that I told you how to get it for free so you know I don&#8217;t work for the company that makes it), I have been a member of 5 different gyms over the past 4 years with great results, just never got to that super lean fit level everyone wants to be at.  After falling off the wagon the last year and gaining 20 lbs, I moved to an area where the local gym is a meat head gym and super uncomfortable to do the things in this program that give you great overall body results.  Nobody wants to stretch and do jump squats when 10 juice heads are staring you down while they endlessly bench press 450 pounds.  </p>
<p>The three years I was really into the gym, I spent literally $1000&#8217;s on supplements, books, magazines, etc&#8230;I have overlooked this program and can say it will DEF work, but it is really made for people who already have fitness experience and maybe fell out of shape (like me), or people who are already in pretty decent shape but want to do something different, get real lean, or save some money.  </p>
<p>I would NOT recommend this for anyone who really overweight, has preexisting injuries, or any kind of major health issue.  It is SUPER intense, even when you pace yourself.  It is a hour and a half commitment (videos plus shower/drink/breaks/etc) 6 days a week, every week, for 90 days.  If you really can&#8217;t see yourself doing that with maybe cutting one of the yoga days out or something once a week at most, don&#8217;t get it.  Also if you are not going to watch your diet don&#8217;t get it&#8230;but don&#8217;t worry to much about it.  Eat breakfast every day with healthy natural foods and a mostly fish/chicken/turkey diet with veggies and fruits, and don&#8217;t eat carbs within 3 hours of going to bed, and you will loose weight.  I would also def get a pre workout and post workout drink, but don&#8217;t worry about getting the P90X stuff or anything fancy.  Some optimum nutrition or GNC protein power will be fine.  I also love Jack3d for energy, but be very careful with this stuff only take if your heart is in good shape, and no more then a scoop at a time unless you have a high tolerance for caffeine (it has 66 mg per scoop).  </p>
<p>My last thought is def get some accessories with it (since I told you how to get it free, you can use that money for bands, pull up bar, push up bars and a mat).  And if you are the least bit hesitant that you are not in good enough shape for this, ask your doctor before trying to jump right into it.  I thought I was in pretty decent shape still and let me tell you, it is no joke you sweat it out non stop for at least an hour each workout.  </p>
<p>Hope this helps whoever stumbles across it&#8230; I KNOW in 90 days I will have lost this 20 lbs, if not more&#8230;if you follow it too and eat good, you will see results as well.  Just gotta BRING IT!!!  </p>

				<p>			
				<p>Ok, so i started with p90x  2 weeks ago. I then stopped for a week &amp; a 1/2 because i had trouble sleeping and did not think it wise to exercise when exhausted. I just started up again this week. I am 5&#8242;1, 125lbs. Im trying to slim down and tone. Since I&#8217;ve heard protein shakes make you gain weight, should i just stick to one post workout for recovery?<br />
And how should i tweak the meals since i&#8217;m on the petite side?</p>
<p class="thdrpy">[<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="movecfm(event,31754,1,'shsa');">Reply</a>]</p><div class="comment-childs chalt" id="comment-34277"><div style="width:80px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.dietspotlight.com/img/ds-reader.jpg" style="padding: 5px;" /></div><div style="width:40px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.dietspotlight.com/img/comment.gif" style="padding: 4px 1px;" /></div><b>Just Started</b> <small class="commentmetadata">June 29th, 2010</small><p>You probably were exhausted because p90x could easily over train someone who was not already in shape.  I considered myself in decent shape, and my first 3 weeks now I modified the system&#8230;I choose to do 2-3 of their routines, with 2-3 days of running 4-5 miles, which still could be a lot for some.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d tone it down, or only do the lean routine, but don&#8217;t do 6 days in a row, pick one or two of the days you could live without and start with only 4 days a week, once your body adjusts add more days/intensity. </p>
<p>As for protein shakes, they do NOT make you gain weight.  Junk food, carbs, fatty stuff, and especially eating any trash within a few hours of going to bed makes you gain weight.  With how intense p90x is, you need to do a shake before and after, and just watch what you eat the rest of the day.  If you want to tone up you need muscle, muscle comes from protein, the more muscle you have the higher your metabolism and the more fat you burn even while watching tv.  </p>
<p>Also a big thing hard for most people to grasp is NOT drinking much, if at all.  I have done 3 solid weeks of p90x and working out, but had 3 weekends in a row of weddings/parties/events where I drank too much and ate junk late night.  I have lost only a few pounds, but others I know who followed it exact and didn&#8217;t drink at all lost 7-12 pounds in their first few weeks.  Anyhow, hope this helps, keep it up!</p>
