				<p>So-called “fad diets” seem to spring up all the time, offering a diet plan to help you lose a lot of weight in a short period of time. Often, they do this by focusing on one or two types of food to either eliminate from the diet completely or to dine on exclusively. Examples of this type of fad diet are Cabbage Soup Diet, Sugar Busters! and the grapefruit soup diets. But can these diets help you lose weight, and do they pose other health risks?</p>
<p>Well, they certainly can help you lose weight. They are all designed to do that, and on that level they are almost all effective, at least for a little while.</p>
<p>But there are risks to many of these diets. Often, vital nutrients are eliminated from your diet for too long, leading to a variety of complications, some of which can be very serious.</p>
<p>Starvation diets where you either limit your diet to one or two foods or reduce the total intake of food can be very dangerous. Your body needs a wide variety of nutrients, balanced effectively for maximum use. If it fails to get what it needs, you can suffer from a variety of issues, some of which can be serious and result in permanent injury.</p>
<p>Many of these diets are especially dangerous to people with diabetes. They can take so drastically lower the dieters blood sugar level that serious complications, even death can result. Studies have also shown that diabetics can be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease when on poorly balanced diets. If the dieter is not aware they have diabetes they have no way to avoid those risks. This is why it is so important to consult your physician before starting any significant weight loss program.</p>
<p>How can a dieter avoid these risks and still lose weight? There are many diets out there that offer sensible and safe ways to shed weight and still be healthy. Some of those plans are outlined in books you can find in your local bookstore. Others can be found online at sites like www.stripthatfat.com. Each of these plans focus on the key things to remember when trying to follow a safe diet.</p>
<p>First, your body needs a balance of sugars, carbohydrates and fats. Research your diet plan for signs that it is balanced and includes the proper nutritional balance of foods, then be sure to follow that plan carefully. Avoid those plans that focus on one or two foods or types of food to the exclusion of all others.</p>
<p>One advantage to on-line programs is that many of them have menu generators that can help you plan healthy meals that still help you lose weight. Others may have on-line food diaries, which have been proven to be effective in helping a dieter manage their diet.</p>
<p>Using these resources will help you stick to a diet that will not only help you lose weight but will do so in a healthy way that will not pose an even greater risk to your health than the excess weight will.</p>

				<h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://www.atkinsdietfriends.com/36/what-not-to-eat-on-a-no-carb-diet/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to What Not To Eat On A No-Carb Diet?">What Not To Eat On A No-Carb Diet?</a></h1>

				<p>Low carbohydrate diets have been popular for a number of years and have recently shown a marked increase in popularity. Part of that popularity has been extended to what are now being called <strong>“no-carb diets.”</strong> Knowing what types of foods to avoid involves understanding what the diet is about.</p>
<p>It is virtually impossible to avoid carbohydrates entirely in your diet, and it would be unhealthy to do so. Your body does need some carbohydrates. A “<strong>no carb</strong>” diet is actually a <strong>very low carb diet</strong>. One example of a no-carb diet is the induction phase of the Atkins plan. There are other diets out there that keep carbs low as a permanent part of the plan. Either way, what foods should a person on one of these diets avoid?</p>
<p>Breads and pastries are the easiest things to identify as being high in carbohydrates. Bread, muffins, crackers and bagels are on the list of things to avoid on low carb diets while no carb diets rule them out altogether. A basic rule is that if it is made with flour, it is not on your diet plan. Pastas fit this rule as well.</p>
<p>Potatoes in all their forms (fried, baked, mashed, etc.) are to be avoided on low and no carb diets. Pastas such as gnocchi and potato breads are similarly to be avoided.</p>
<p>Another food to avoid is rice. Brown and whole-grain rices are okay in later stages of low carb diets, but are not on a no carb diet (or the first stages of low-carb diets for that matter). Both of these types of diets recommend avoiding white rices.</p>
<p>Cereals are another food to avoid. This includes not only cold cereals that you pour milk over and serve but also hot cereals such as oatmeal and cream of wheat.</p>
<p>Beans such as black beans, kidney beans and pinto beans are to be avoided as they are high in carbs. Corn and carrots are other vegetables to avoid as both are high in sugar and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Fruits to avoid include (but may not be limited to) apricots, bananas, blueberries, dates, grapefruits and figs.</p>
<p>Milk has carbohydrates in the form of lactose sugar. Many of those sugars get taken out of milk in the process of making cheese, but watch out for plain milk and cream. Those sugars are still in there.</p>
<p>Another good rule of thumb on no-carb diets is to avoid all processed and packaged food. Invariably, they are loaded up with sugary and carb-heavy ingredients in an effort to compensate for the loss of taste inherent in the preservation and packaging processes. This is especially true of so-called reduced fat foods. They are even higher in sugars and carbs than their higher fat counterparts.</p>
<p>Lastly, avoid sweets. High sugar foods are also high in carbohydrates. Avoid cakes, candies and other sweets. Following all of these rules will help you stick to your <strong>no carb diet</strong>.</p>

				<p>According to Veronica Atkins, the widow of Dr. Robert Atkins, the cause of his death was from falling on a slippery sidewalk with subsequent irreversible brain damage (from a CNN interview, February, 2004). Many critics of the Atkins Diet Plan claim the fall was due to a heart attack. This has not been verified to date.</p>
<p>He was 72 years old.</p>
<p>With all due respect to Veronica Atkins, I would like to assume Dr. Atkins did in fact suffer a fatal heart attack. This is in order to answer the following questions&#8230;Is it right to use his death as evidence against the safety of the Atkins Diet Plan and other low Carb diets?</p>
<p>Does the recent bankruptcy of the Atkins Corporation provide evidence for the ineffectiveness of low Carb diets?</p>
<p>Many critics of low Carb diets say yes to both questions, but are they right?</p>
<p><strong>The Atkins Diet Plan &amp; Cardiovascular Risk</strong></p>
<p>Medically speaking, it is incorrect to associate Dr. Atkins&#8217; fatal heart attack to the use of his low Carb diet. There are two reasons for coming to this conclusion.The increased risk for cardiovascular events associated with Atkins Diet Plan are not from restricting carbohydrates. Instead, the higher risk of cardiovascular events comes from replacing carbohydrates with foods high in saturated fats.</p>
<p>Dr. Atkins died at the age of 72. Beyond the age of 72, the risk for a cardiovascular event is the same for everyone. Granted, he was diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy (diseased heart muscle) when he was 69 and he suffered a heart attack in early 2004.</p>
<p>However, both events occurred well above the age of 55&#8230;the cut off used for men to assign an increased risk for cardiovascular events to their first degree relatives. He was at an age which allows for the exclusion of any significant cardiovascular risk passing to his children.</p>
<p>From an epidemiology view point, risk behaviors like smoking or eating a high fat diet are no longer considered as primary contributors in Dr. Atkins&#8217; death.</p>
<p>Yes, eating a high fat diet may have played a role, but this is only speculation. Because Dr. Atkins was 72 at the time of his death, no risk for similar events is passed onto his first degree relatives and the risk for cardiovascular events is the same for everyone at that age.</p>
<p>With all due respect, he died of old age. To blame the Atkins Diet Plan and low Carb diets in general is medically irresponsible. At 72 years old, there are several factors to consider when faced with a fatal heart attack, including the aging process itself.</p>
<p>Veronica Atkins was quoted by CNN&#8230;<br />
&#8220;My husbands health at the time of his death is a sad and distracting sideshow, taking time away from an intelligent debate of the known science.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion on cardiovascular risk and age, please visit&#8230;  <a title="www.medscape.com" href="http://www.atkinsdietfriends.com/www.medscape.com" target="_blank">www.medscape.com </a></p>
<p>Low Carb Bankruptcy &#8212; Evidence for its Ineffectiveness?</p>
<p>The only correct way to measure a diet&#8217;s effectiveness (or lack there of) is to study the evidence provided by clinical trials. Recently, a few good studies have reported on the effectiveness of the Atkins Diet Plan and other low Carb diets.</p>
<p>In short, low Carb diets, measured at one year, are safe and effective in helping dieters lose weight.</p>
<p>Like all diet types, the evidence for long term effectiveness (2 to 5 years) is sparse and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular risk increases for some dieters on low Carb diets, not because of the carbohydrate restriction, but because of the consumption of foods high in fat. Also, sticking with the low Carb diet appears to be tough for most dieters beyond one year.</p>
<p>And lastly, low Carb diets that promote long stages of measurable ketosis may cause rapid weight loss that is too extreme. This is a great way to guarantee weight regain in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Atkins death, from whatever the cause, can not be associated with his diet because he was 72 years old at the time of his death. Even if Dr. Atkins&#8217; death could be associated with his diet, no correlations could be made to similar low Carb diets, too much variation exists between them.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy does not belong in a scientific discussion of a diet&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>

				<p>If you have made it past the initial induction phase of the Atkins Diet, congratulations on accomplishing the first stage of your weight loss goal. The ongoing weight loss phase(OWL) you are entering into now is where you will being to customize the Atkins program to fit your individual tastes which is what makes the Atkins Diet Program so unique in the diet and weight loss world.</p>
<p>Even though you are now allowed a little more flexibility than in the induction phase of the program this second stage will continue to amaze you with the how much the weight will continue to drop and the fat melt off.</p>
<p>You will begin to see a gradual slow down of the rate in which the weight loss and inches lost occur. This is a normal and deliberate part of the plan so don&#8217;t let it bother you. Just bear in mind that just because you are being allowed a few more carbs it doesn&#8217;t mean you can go back to eating whatever you want. You must eat good quality carbs and steer clear of junk carbs such as white flour and sugar.</p>
<p>You must also have a set goal. Do not just make a goal of losing some weight, have a specific amount of weight you want to lose and write the goal down. It is much easier to visualize you end goal when it is written down. You must visualize and see how your body will look and how you will feel when you reach your goal.</p>
<p>With the Ongoing Weight Loss Program you will learn to continue to burn and dissolve fat, maintain control of your appetite, learn how many more carbs you can take in and eat a wider choice of foods.</p>
<p>The following are the main rules of Ongoing Weight Loss:</p>
<p>Keep protein and fat as the mainstays of your nutritional regimen</p>
<p>Do not increase your daily carb intake by more than five grams a week</p>
<p>Add new foods in the order listed in the Atkins carb ladder</p>
<p>Only add one food group at a time</p>
<p>Stop new foods immediately if they promote weight gain or increased cravings</p>
<p>Continue on Ongoing Weight Loss until you have five to ten pounds to lose.</p>
<p>If you follow these guidelines you are sure to be successful in your quest for weight loss.</p>

				<h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://www.atkinsdietfriends.com/33/atkins-diet-is-it-as-effective-as-they-say/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Atkins Diet &#8211; Is it as Effective as they say?">Atkins Diet &#8211; Is it as Effective as they say?</a></h1>

				<p>Even though it has been several decades since the late Dr. Robert Atkins created his self-named low carbohydrate diet, it was only in the late 1990s and early 2000s that the Atkins diet took the weight loss world by storm.</p>
<p>Millions of people rode on the low carb bandwagon and nutrition experts were appalled. The uproar over the diet is understandable; after all, it went against all the principles of the medically accepted and traditional low fat regimen, which had been the norm for years.</p>
<p>Simply put, going on the Atkins diet &#8211; or &#8220;doing Atkins&#8221; &#8211; means that a person has to drastically cut down on his or her intake of carbohydrates, especially those found in starchy foods.</p>
<p>People find that this can be difficult, especially those who have become accustomed to consuming food like bread, potatoes, cakes, cereals, and pasta regularly for years. On the up side, protein-rich foods are not only allowed on this low carb diet, they are actually encouraged. So there&#8217;s no need to give up mayonnaise, butter, pork, beef, fried food, and many others that are off-limits in low fat diets.</p>
<p>There are four phases in this diet. The first stage, called Induction, requires the dieter to reduce his or her carb intake to 20 grams per day for two weeks. Carbohydrates should be acquired from vegetables, so the usual starchy baked products and fruits are forbidden during this period.</p>
<p>After the induction phase, you are allowed to gradually increase your intake of carbohydrates until you reach your carb threshold, or the amount of carbs you can safely eat without gaining weight.</p>
<p>For many adults, 60 to 90 grams of carbs per day is the limit. With this diet, you count carbs, not calories.</p>
<p>The Atkins premise is that carbohydrates, which our bodies use for fuel, are the culprits responsible for weight gain. Excess carbohydrates increase blood sugar levels, which in turn make us feel hungry in a short amount of time after a meal. An increase in your blood sugar can also trigger the pancreas to create more insulin, which in turn influences how the body converts carbs to fats, which are manifested in that paunch or those love handles.</p>
<p>This extra weight can lead to many health problems, including diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>In addition to helping a person lose a significant amount of weight in a short period of time, a number of clinical studies have shown the Atkins diet to be beneficial in the reduction of the so-called &#8220;bad cholesterol&#8221; that can lead to heart disease.</p>
<p>In addition, other studies suggest that the diet has at least a positive short-term effect on diabetics, and anecdotal evidence states that it is also instrumental in relieving the symptoms of disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
<p>One thing that the critics praise about the Atkins low carb diet is its education of people about being picky about foods; to avoid junk food and those that contain nothing but sugar and empty calories.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the diet that meets with expert approval is its encouragement of exercise. It still follows the basic tenet that if you take in more than you burn, you will still gain weight, no matter what diet you are on.</p>
<p>One relative difficulty that reduced-carbohydrate dieters complain about is food boredom. Perhaps this was a problem in the early days, but not so anymore.</p>
<p>Today, there are plenty of &#8220;mock&#8221; foods patterned after regular dishes like pancakes, mashed potatoes, cheesecake, muffins, and the like &#8211; but without the carbohydrates and sugar. If you have a craving for something sweet, you can still eat candy bars, cakes, and chocolate products that are sweetened not with sugar but with sucralose.</p>
<p>Weight loss on this low carb diet is quicker than that observed on low-fat diets, but remember that you should not shed pounds too rapidly &#8211; 2 to four pounds a week is the average.</p>
<p>And to make sure to take the necessary dietary supplements to make sure that you are getting all the nutrients you need to stay healthy while losing weight. You should also remember to drink plenty of water.</p>
<p>This will help flush waste from your body and assist it in the burning of fat as the major source of fuel.</p>
<p>Going on the Atkins diet can help you in your weight loss efforts if you follow the basic tenets: don&#8217;t overeat (eat only until you feel satisfied);</p>
<p>don&#8217;t under-eat (eat whenever you feel hungry);</p>
<p>exercise; be realistic. You should not aspire to be razor thin. Rather, aim for your ideal body weight and stay<br />
healthy on your way there.</p>
