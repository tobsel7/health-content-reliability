Honestly... she didn't think any of it through (the money, time, and criticism) not to mention the fact... the 14 kids are going to need serious help. She's in way over her head. I thing the doctors should never had agreed to implanting 8 embryos at once- it's a very risky thing to do- and they knew she already had six kids! In case anyone didn't know. she apparently struggled to become pregnant for years. I believe that has a lot to do with why she's had so many kids. And what about the Octuplets? They will suffer with serious illnesses for their entire lives (the inability of the mother to breastfeed 8 babies prevents them from receiving essential antibodies, and nutrients vital for normal brain development) Don't get me wrong, I love kids too, but this woman has seriously gone overboard! Our tax money wasn't meant to pay for someone who decides to have 7 times the average amount of children.</p>

<p>I'm not commenting on this particular situation at all, but I had to chime in to object to the implication that a child that is not breast fed is going to &quot;suffer with serious illnesses for their entire lives.&quot; Come on now. Those children may have problems, but not because they will be deprived of breast milk.</p>

<p>This woman is mentally ill. &nbsp;When will Social Services intervene and take the babies away from her? &nbsp;Maybe, she can make some money from the adoptions. &nbsp;That might be motivation for her. &nbsp;Also she needs to have her tubes tied. &nbsp;Where are the Psychiatrists and Medical Docs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel that she is committing a crime by deliberately creating situations where she will require more and more financial and social support from this country. &nbsp;There are so many needy people who need help. &nbsp;Is she a citizen? &nbsp;Who paid for her facial plastic surgery?</p>
<p>The fertility doctor needs to be investigated. &nbsp;Also, why did he move out of the previous state in which he practiced?</p>
<p>In response to &quot;Ren&quot;, I may disgust you, however I DO have a life. &nbsp;I have a university degree and HAVE contributed a great deal in the delivery of health care throughout my career. &nbsp;People who are functioning in the realm of reality are upset by the news about Nadya Suleman because they KNOW what kind of effort it requires emotionally and physically to raise even one child. &nbsp;At the present time, these babies and older children are at high risk for many emotional and developmental problems, not to mention nutritional and other health issues.</p>

<p>The first thing I thought when I saw a picture of her was how striking a resemblence she has to Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p>I also saw the horrific fingernails she sports and wondered how any mother could work around fragile babies safely with these 'sharp instruments'.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the 14 children and all the other people who have been dragged into this situation by this mentally unbalanced and selfish woman.</p>
<p>I hope the children will be closely monitored to ensure their safety and well-being.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are understably upset. It's their money that's being used and it's tough times.</p>
<p>Oh, I and I do have a life too. I read the news and sometimes write in. It's called freedom of speech.</p>
