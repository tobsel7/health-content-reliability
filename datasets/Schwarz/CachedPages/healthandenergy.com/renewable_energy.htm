fossil fuels, so it is essential that we do not wait until fossil fuels

<h2><b><font size="6"><font color="#000000">Nations Vow to Promote </font>
<font color="#008000">Renewable Energy</font></font></b></h2>
</font><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>By Geir Moulson<br>
Associated Press </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday 04 June 2004 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonn, Germany - More than 150 nations pledged Friday to promote 
alternative energy sources &quot;with a sense of urgency,&quot; closing a global 
conference marked by warnings about the vulnerability of world oil 
supplies to terrorism. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Renewables 2004 conference set no specific global targets, 
but approved an &quot;international action program&quot; of 192 projects by 
governments and international organizations to further wind, solar, 
geothermal and other energies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final declaration said governments &quot;reaffirm their commitment 
to substantially increase with a sense of urgency the global share of 
renewable energy in the total energy supply.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome received a generally positive response from 
environmental groups. World Wildlife Fund activist Stephan Singer said 
it moved the cause of renewable energies &quot;dramatically forward.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We think it's the best possible document for the time being,&quot; he 
said, adding that his organization was happy &quot;to see that countries like 
the United States, Saudi Arabia and others committed (to the idea that) 
that renewable energies are a major part of the future.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany proposed the four-day conference after the 2002 World 
Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, failed 
to agree on timetables and targets for expanding renewable energy use, 
despite European pressure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gained urgency because of soaring oil prices and attacks on 
foreign workers in Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder urged delegates Thursday to 
&quot;address the fact that the global economy's one-sided dependence on oil 
greatly increases our vulnerability to such terrorism.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 154-nation Bonn meeting gathered a series of individual 
commitments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ranged from China's pledge to draw up a development strategy 
for renewable energy through a promise of increased funding by the World 
Bank to a French-German-Afghan initiative to improve energy access in 
rural Afghanistan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States pledged research and development efforts to 
bring down the cost of solar and wind energy, and said it would expand 
production tax credits for alternative energies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have sent an important political message to the world,&quot; 
Germany's development minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, said in a 
closing speech. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We must be clear that, given the huge demand in developing 
countries, the world will need far more energy than today,&quot; she said. 
&quot;So an enormous expansion of renewable energies is needed.&quot; </p>

<h2>ZOGBY POLL REVEALS SUPPORT FOR RENEWABLES </h2>
<p>February 3, 2003</p>
<p>A recently-released poll shows that energy efficiency and expanded 
development of renewable energy sources like wind and solar continue to 
be more popular by far than trying to increase oil and gas supplies.</p>
<p>The poll by Zogby International, conducted for the Wilderness Society 
from November 5-7, 2003, involved 1,003 likely voters chosen at random 
nationwide, and has an error margin of +/- 3.2 percentage points.</p>
<p>More than three of four voters support investing either in energy 
efficiency or renewable energy instead of trying to increase oil and gas
</p>
<p>supplies. When asked, &#147;Which of the following do you think is the 
best way to address the nation&#146;s energy needs?&#148; 40% responded, &#147;Use 
energy more efficiently and develop more fuel-efficient cars and trucks 
so we use less oil;&#148; 37% responded, &#147;Expand development of alternative 
forms of energy like wind and solar power;&#148; 16% said, &#147;Drill for more 
oil and gas in the US to increase our energy supply;&#148; and 2% said, &#147;Get 
our oil-producing allies in other countries to send us more oil.&#148;</p>
<p>Overwhelming majorities of Democrats (82%), Independents (80%), and 
Republicans (70%) say that investing in energy efficiency and renewable 
energy sources is preferable to drilling for more oil and gas in the 
U.S. </p>
<p>Similarly strong majorities exist in every region of the country and 
among all age, race, education and income categories. </p>

COOL THE PLANET</font></b></h2>
<p>During the spring of 2004, Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph 
Lieberman (D-Conn.) came close but ultimately were unable to bring their Climate 
Stewardship Act to a vote in the Senate&nbsp;in July.&nbsp; The bill is a comprehensive 
national policy that would set the first mandatory limits on U.S. emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.&nbsp; McCain and Lieberman had been 
hoping for an even better showing of support than the 43 senators who sided with 
the measure in November 2003.&nbsp; That strong bipartisan vote shattered the myth 
that the U.S. Senate would never seriously consider action to address global 
warming. Senator McCain has vowed to keep bringing the issue back until the 
Senate takes a responsible approach to climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000"><b><font face="Times New Roman">T</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">he Kyoto Conference once again placed 
environmental issues before the public, if only for a few days. On a per 
capita basis, America is far and away the world&#146;s leading emitter of 
gasses that most scientists &#151;except those who follow Limbaugh logic&#151; 
believe contribute to global warming. Conventional wisdom holds that the 
fix is to limit emissions of greenhouse gasses, most of which are due to 
the burning of fossil fuels. The focus of debate at Kyoto was on 
limiting emissions: by how much; by which country; and by when.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">The American delegation 
in Kyoto seemed about as eager to adopt decisive action on limiting 
emissions, as our nation&#146;s leaders were to sign the Ottawa Treaty 
banning landmines. &quot;Seems like a good idea, but we need more time&quot; was a 
constant refrain in both cases, ignoring Martin Luther King&#146;s insight 
that &quot;<em>it&#146;s always the right time to do what&#146;s right&quot;.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Perhaps there are some 
people who believe it&#146;s a God-given right for Americans to foul the 
environment and that we should exercise this right with all due vigor. I 
hope their numbers are few. I suspect that the majority of those who 
favor foot dragging on limiting emissions&#151;most of which are due to 
burning fossil fuels&#151;believe that the current economic miracle is fueled 
by cheap energy. Hence, they fear that actions that threaten to limit 
consumption or raise prices may have deleterious effects on Wall 
Street&#146;s Sacred Bull.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">My view is that the 
potential for global warming is but one of many powerful reasons to 
substantially reduce our use of fossil fuels. Further, the economy as a 
whole will be better off if we redouble our efforts to attack the 
problem now, and on many fronts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">However, in allocating 
resources, I think it&#146;s important to frame the &quot;renewable&quot; resources 
question quite carefully. All too frequently, when renewable sources of 
energy are discussed, the implicit assumption is that we need to meet 
our present and future &quot;energy needs&quot; with a mix of renewable and 
non-renewable sources that increasingly emphasizes the renewable. My 
concern is that this way of stating the problem assumes that the &quot;needs&quot; 
are a given; therefore the agenda should be to find alternative energy 
sources to meet them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Ironically, the pursuit 
of alternative sources has taught us a great lesson about our presumed 
needs. Let me illustrate in the housing and transportation sectors.</font></p>
<i><b>
<h3><big><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Housing</font></big></h3>
</b></i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">An average home in 
upstate New York uses about 125 million BTUs to heat it during the 
winter. Typically, fuels like natural gas or fuel oil are used to supply 
this heat&#151;the energy equivalent of about 125 person years of labor&#151;at an 
annual cost of from $840 to $1,000 if using oil or natural gas. It is 
possible to design an active solar system to totally meet this need. In 
many climate areas, there is adequate insolation (sunshine) to supply 
solar heating during the winter, but in the Syracuse area, long-term 
storage is the only practical alternative. Solar energy needs to be 
collected when the sun is out and stored for when it&#146;s needed. Water is 
probably the least expensive medium of storage, but it would require a 
20,000 cubic foot super-insulated tank to do the job. (Imagine a 
swimming-pool-size container 40 feet x 50 feet by 10 feet deep covered 
with 6 inches of urethane.) The system would also require a solar array 
of 1,000 square feet or so (depending on the efficiencies of its 
elements), a pair of heat exchangers, several pumps, and a set of 
controls. The cost of such a system would be several tens of thousands 
of dollars, even for the do-it-yourselfer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">It&#146;s enough to drive you 
to ask why you need 125 MBTUs to heat your home over the winter. The 
answer is that it may be due to many reasons, but a list of frequently 
occurring culprits includes:</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Inadequate insulation</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Improperly installed 
 insulation</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Air leakage, 
 particularly at the top and bottom of the heated envelope</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Leaky and poorly 
 insulated ducts</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Inefficient furnace</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Bad (or badly set) 
 controls</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Notice that windows and 
doors are not on this list. Replacing windows or doors is not usually 
cost effective unless the existing windows are major sources of air 
leakage that can only be treated by replacement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Depending on what&#146;s 
wrong, it&#146;s often possible to halve the heating energy use of typical 
upstate homes for two or three thousand dollars. The greater the energy 
use per square foot, the easier (and more cost effective) it is to save 
energy. (Savings follows waste!) Nonetheless, even if somewhat heroic 
measures are taken, it&#146;s hard to get 2,000 square foot houses down below 
50 MBTUs for the heating season. Although that&#146;s within reach of an 
active solar system, the best approach would probably be to use the 
active system to heat domestic hot water and supply some space heating 
during colder months, leaving the dead of winter for back-up sources 
like wood, coal, oil, or gas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">New dwellings offer 
better opportunities. Paul Howells, a scientist at the Syracuse Research 
Corporation, pioneered a simple construction technique that has the 
thermal virtues of a cave without the depravities of living underground. 
The result is a home which costs substantially less than conventional 
housing stock, is more comfortable, and can be heated for 10-12 
MBTU/year, 10 percent that of a typical home. It uses the earth to 
buffer the home from temperature extremes and is quite comfortable in 
summer as well as winter. Heavy perimeter insulation in installed to 
thermally isolate the earth under the dwelling from the surrounding 
soil. Thick walls built like pole barns permit the installation of lots 
of insulation. Conventional trusses span large areas between exterior 
walls, making it easy to install a vapor barrier that seals the 
structure thoroughly. Combined with heavy attic insulation, a number of 
these houses have been built with R45 walls and R 60 ceilings. Careful 
attention is given to ventilation, which is controlled to ensure good 
indoor air quality while avoiding energy waste. Most of these homes also 
have 100 square feet or so of high-quality glazing (R-10 glazing is now 
widely available) oriented within 30 degrees of south. This passive 
solar feature is usually combined with an overhang to limit direct sun 
during summer months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">The very modest 
remaining heating energy needs of the structure may be met with a small, 
efficient wood stove (distribution of energy from single sources like 
wood stoves in tight, well-insulated homes is quite good) or even a 
conventional hot water heater fueled by a fossil fuel. In all events, 
the home may be left throughout the winter with no energy input at all; 
the fact that it is ideally insulated and coupled to the earth means 
that it will never drop below 55 degrees on the coldest day of the year. 
Further, a small, cheap active solar system could be employed to supply 
hot water needs for perhaps eight months of the year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Is such a dwelling a 
solar home? Well, sure, it makes good and appropriate use of this 
marvelously renewable resource when it is available. I prefer to think 
of it as a dwelling that uses &quot;alternative&quot; energy resources, in this 
case good air sealing techniques and excellent insulation.</font></p>
<i><b>
<h3><big><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Transportation</font></big></h3>
</b></i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">The pursuit of solar 
vehicles has yielded analogous results. A gallon of gasoline is a very 
concentrated form of energy. The sun is a powerful resource, but it is 
quite diffuse. (Only several hundred BTUs per square foot per hour are 
available to any collection system, however efficient.) Accordingly, one 
doesn&#146;t begin with 3,000 pounds of pig iron with the fancy option 
package from an assembly line in Detroit. No, we have to learn to build 
much more elegant vehicles that are light, sleek, and strong. What&#146;s 
evolving are super light cars made of carbon fiber with efficient 
electric motors at each wheel. These are fueled by electricity generated 
on board by fuel cells that burn hydrogen and produce only pure water 
vapor in the exhaust. Meanwhile a small on-board battery is charged when 
the brakes are applied, temporarily turning motors into generators. A 
small microprocessor coordinates the drive and energy functions to 
maximize efficiency and safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Note that designing to 
make good use of renewables results in creative thinking about our needs 
in the first place. In the housing and transportation sectors, there&#146;s 
strong evidence that our needs may be less than expected. (Indeed, if 
high-speed trains became a reality, perhaps Americans&#146; love affair with 
the automobile and airplane could be abated. Passenger trains can 
achieve upwards of 2,000 passenger miles per gallon of fuel.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">These examples could be 
multiplied many fold. A few years ago, the average refrigerator used 
over 1200 kilowatts a year. Now, redesign forced by federal standards 
has yielded off-the-shelf refrigerators that use less than 500 kWh per 
year. At Synertech, we&#146;re presently testing a 15 cubic foot automatic 
defrost unit that uses 350 kWh per year in 70 degree F kitchens. In 
bulk, they are available for only $330 apiece. The &quot;secret&quot; is better 
insulation, better controls, and better compressors; all assembled using 
more efficient techniques. The wide-scale adoption of energy-efficient 
refrigerators in this country alone will negate the need for building at 
least half a dozen large (800-megawatt) new power plants! For now, at 
least, an energy-efficient refrigerator represents a much better 
investment than active solar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Neither the generation 
of electricity through photovoltaic cells or via concentrating 
reflectors that produce steam to turn generators are particularly 
economically attractive in our area yet, but photovoltaics may become 
so. As always, the trick is to limit demand by conservation-which we 
should be doing even if we&#146;re still using the stuff from Niagara Mohawk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">There are lots of clever 
ways to do it. For example, there&#146;s a home just south of Syracuse that 
has a small energy-efficient refrigerator which, like the rest of the 
house, runs off of photovoltaics. The energy-efficient refrigerator 
makes a gallon or two of ice each day, which in turn is used to cool a 
conventional refrigerator that had been discarded because of a failed 
compressor. Retrofitted with extra insulation, it serves as a very nice 
icebox. During winter months when photovoltaic power generation is down, 
the external world supplies the ice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">One of the most 
promising uses of solar energy is to provide natural lighting. The sun 
produces both light and heat. Trying to take advantage of heat in mid 
winter when fossil fuel energy is so cheap is problematic, as we have 
seen. However, in mid summer, solar lighting is very much available and 
may be put to a number of good uses. Its color properties are better 
than anything yet invented by humankind and utility companies haven&#146;t 
figured out how to meter the source. Best of all, sunlight provides 
light very efficiently, which means that air conditioning loads in 
commercial buildings are lowered. Again, the trick is to design elegant, 
simple systems. In this case, the aim is to direct the sun to where it 
does the most good while minimizing glare. This is the principal area of 
research at Synertech, and some exciting new designs are under 
development.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">It is not politically 
popular to point out the obvious. Nonetheless, exponential growth in the 
use of non-renewable resources is simply impossible; our finite globe 
can&#146;t sustain it. Nor can our atmosphere and waters sustain exponential 
growth in pollutants. The leading cause of both is waste, not &quot;need&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Our challenge is not to 
meet our energy needs with &quot;alternative&quot; energy sources. Our challenge 
is to meet our needs as human beings &#151; to live well. To me, living well 
means comfortable, safe, housing; good indoor and outdoor air and water 
quality; wholesome, safe food; efficient, reliable, safe transportation, 
and the opportunity to create in peace. Energy consequences flow from 
these, but better living certainly does not necessitate more 
consumption.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">We have the opportunity 
to create new systems-and retrofit old ones-with a view to minimizing 
waste and maximizing people functions. Genuinely elegant systems take 
advantage of &quot;alternative&quot; as well as renewable resources of many 
varieties.</font></p>

<h3><big><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Energy Costs</font></big></h3>
</b></i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">The cost of energy 
varies substantially with what might be called its &quot;quality&quot;. In the 
sense meant, electricity is judged of higher quality both because it is 
usually manufactured by heat engines that burn fuels of lower quality 
(wood, coal, gas, oil, uranium) at efficiencies of only 35 percent or 
so. Electricity is often the most convenient source of power. However, 
since electrical energy is sold by the kilowatt-hour, it is difficult to 
compare its costs with wood by the cord, coal by the ton, gas by the 
therm, or oil by the gallon. Accordingly, it is convenient to express 
all energy sources in a common unit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">A BTU is the energy 
necessary to raise a pound of water one-degree Fahrenheit. It follows, 
for example, that a hundred thousand BTUs (a therm) is the energy 
necessary to raise 10,000 pounds of water 10 degrees F. In people terms, 
a million BTUs (MBTUs) is the energy equivalent of about a person year 
of labor. As mentioned, it takes about 125 MBTUs to heat an average home 
for a winter in Central New York.</font></p>

some sample retail costs of energy to small consumers in New York State:</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Several important 
inferences may be drawn from this data. First, energy in America is 
still widely available for a very modest cost. A gallon of gas costs 
only $1.20 here (it&#146;s more than four times this number in most developed 
nations), yet it contains the energy equivalent of two months of labor. 
Second, the high-quality energy called electricity costs a lot more than 
the other fuels (although it&#146;s still a bargain in this country. 
Electricity costs more than a dollar per kWh in Japan, $300 per MBTU).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">A national public opinion survey released by a 
broad coalition of business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy 
organizations confirms that most citizens believe renewable energy and 
energy efficiency should be given priority for federal energy funding 
but that nuclear power and fossil fuels should be the first technologies 
subject to budget cuts.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Furthermore, by large margins, the public 
favors inclusion of provisions to promote <i>sustainable energy technol</i>ogies 
and consumer disclosure in federal electric utility restructuring 
legislation but oppose having electricity customers pay for uneconomic 
nuclear plants. Finally, Americans overwhelmingly support federal tax 
incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy in electricity 
production and to encourage the purchase of energy-efficient 
automobiles, homes, and heating and cooling systems.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">These are among the key findings of the survey, 
&quot;America Speaks Out on Energy: Funding Priorities, Electric Utility 
Restructuring, and Tax Incentives&quot; conducted for the Sustainable Energy 
Coalition by Research/Strategy/ Management, Inc. of Sterling, Virginia 
from May 10-18 among a sample of 1,029 adult Americans 18 years of age 
and older. The survey has a margin of error of +/-3.0%.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">For the fifth year in a row, a majority of all 
Americans (62%), and more than two-thirds (69%) of those expressing a 
preference, would give the highest priority to funding the U.S. 
Department of Energy's (DOE) renewable energy (i.e., solar, wind, 
geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric) and energy efficiency research 
and development (R&amp;D) programs. On the other hand, nearly a third (31%) 
of respondents selected nuclear power as the first R&amp;D program that 
should be subject to budget cuts, followed by fossil fuels (21%). Only 
5% would cut funding for energy efficiency R&amp;D while just 9% would 
reduce the renewable energy budget.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">These findings, which reflect even higher 
levels of support for sustainable energy programs than were measured in 
the Coalition's earlier polls, cut across all political, gender, age, 
geographic, and income categories. Ironically, recent votes by the House 
Science Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee would allocate 
federal energy dollars in a manner completely at odds with the public's 
preferences.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">By large margins, 78% of respondents support 
including a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard requiring 10% of 
electricity be generated from solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass 
sources as part of federal electric utility restructuring legislation. 
In addition, 59% favor creating a Public Benefits Fund, supported by a 
2-3% surcharge on utility bills, to fund energy efficiency, low-income 
energy assistance, and renewable energy R&amp;D programs. There is also 
near-unanimity (89%) among Americans that electricity providers should 
be required to tell their customers the type of fuel being used to 
generate electricity as well as the type and amounts of air pollutants 
being emitted.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">However, a lopsided majority (76%) of consumers 
believe electric utilities' shareholders, and not their customers, 
should be required to pay off the cost of uneconomic nuclear power 
plants as the utility industry is deregulated. Neither the White House 
nor anyone in Congress has yet to introduce a utility restructuring 
proposal that reflects the public's preferences.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">More than 80% of respondents favor tax 
incentives to increase the use of renewable energy for the production of 
electricity either strongly (45%) or at least somewhat (36%). 
Furthermore, Americans overwhelmingly support making tax incentives 
available to encourage the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles, new 
homes, and heating and cooling equipment. More than three-quarters (77%) 
support such incentives for the purchase of automobiles that are at 
least twice as energy efficient as the average new car either strongly 
(46%) or at least somewhat (31%).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">An even larger share of citizens (83%) support 
tax incentives to spur the purchase of new homes that are at least 30% 
more energy efficient than the average new home either strongly (51%) or 
at least somewhat (32%). Finally, 84% of those surveyed believe tax 
incentives should be made available to encourage the purchase of home 
heating and cooling systems that are at least 30% more energy-efficient 
with a majority (51%) agreeing strongly and another third (33%) agreeing 
at least somewhat. The findings suggest that the public is ready to 
support the Clinton Administration's yet-to-be-introduced package of tax 
incentives that comprise its Climate Change Technology Initiative.</font></p>

<h2>Will We Increase&nbsp;Energy Efficiency and Build Enough Renewable Energy 
Systems 
Before It Becomes Too Late?</h2>
</b>
<p>Throughout history, groups of people have managed to ignore problems 
until it was too late to prevent serious consequences. <i>Example</i>: 
Waiting until the Titanic began sinking before deciding that the ship 
should have had lifeboats for more than half of the passengers and crew.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a fatal flaw in our nation's current planning and 
efforts to keep our energy supplies adequate and affordable. There are 
several reasons why the fuels often seem to be the least expensive 
source of energy in the USA:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Retail costs cover exploration, drilling, extraction, 
 transportation, processing, profit margin and sales taxes but not the 
 cost of creating fuels, because they were created at no cost to 
 mankind.</li>
	<li>Retail fuel costs do not reflect true societal costs such as 
 environmental, health, government R &amp; D, subsidies to energy suppliers, 
 and the military costs associated with protecting foreign oil sources.</li>
	<li>Fuels are priced as &#147;sustainable&#148; commodities rather than as the 
 &#147;finite&#148; commodities that they are, and thus do not reflect the costs 
 of whatever must replace them as fuel reserves become depleted.</li>
	<li>Our federal government continues to use our tax dollars to depress 
 the retail prices of fuels and the electricity from generators powered 
 by fuels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Government subsidies could continue to make the use of fuels appear 
to be less expensive than the use of renewable energy sources until 
nearly all of our world's fuels have been consumed. If we allow that to 
happen, then we would no longer have the massive amounts of fuels 
necessary for adequately expanding the use of renewable energy systems 
and improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p>We may not know the true value of fuels until our remaining fuel 
reserves run low and we need to find adequate alternatives. Mankind has 
about 34 cubic miles of oil reserves remaining and is presently 
consuming about one cubic mile each year. Our inadequate domestic supply 
of natural gas and our growing dependence on foreign oil imports provide 
clues that our growing population has no time or fuel to waste if we 
intend to build enough renewable energy systems to sustain everyone in 
the USA during the post-fossil-fuel era.</p>

    beyond our vision,</strong> but it is not completely beyond our control. It

    irresistible tides of history, but the work of our own hands, matched to 
    reason and principle, that will determine our destiny. There is pride in 
    that, even arrogance, but there is also experience and truth. In any event, 
    it is the only way we can live.&quot;<br>
