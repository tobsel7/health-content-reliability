<p>" He needs some -- you need somebody than listen we've been -- teasing and all morning we're very excited that we're having your own course she'd join us he's the co author of the book unfit for command part of the movement to bring out the truth of <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch69" matchId="3" eztype="kw">John</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch70" matchId="3" eztype="kw">Kerry's</b>  service in Vietnam. And he also wrote the abomination. The -- to have the same level success with. Bring in a Republican victory in the most recent presidential election but that wouldn't work out quite as well. And doubt it will we want to talk with doctor accorsi about. What's gone on what this whole swirl of the kinda under the radar activity. Two to get to the bottom of the credentials and and and the Reza may have <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch71" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch72" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>.  With regard to his word was born in what is citizenship is -- reception actually an entitlement eligible to be president United States is very interest inquiry lots and lots of questions and not many answers. As many chances to at least not not that are coming -- forthcoming from Iraq and India -- his campaign team but hopefully it's coming from Geraldo you're welcome back to WRK a nice -- here with Thomas --"</p>
<p>" Great pleasure to be back with you thank you so what's the -- Well we just devoted the whole issue world net daily of the whistle -- monthly magazine in April this whole issue the first certificate. The truth is that <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch73" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch74" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  still stonewalling. The release of his original birth certificate and that's the simple document that. The hospital he was born and he says hospital generated certificate as we all have one. -- the time for the -- the weight of the baby. Parents all that Monday information he refuses to release. As well his information about his schooling we don't have any of the school records. And there are questions for instance and occidental. -- problem was rooming with Pakistan any students but typically universities don't put US. Kids together with foreign exchange students and housing. I was able approve an abomination that Wendell bottle was child and Indonesia with this stepfather. Adopt the records from the two schools he attended. It was listed as a possible and as the Indonesian citizen. So to <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch75" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch76" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  camp Indonesian passport did he applies -- the battle as a Indonesian citizen that he gets foreign aid. We don't have the documents and the White House now continues to refuse to release the."</p>
<p>" Yeah so it's really a fascinating issue that -- very basic question. Of why doesn't <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch77" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch78" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  put to win once and for all all the lawsuits. All the inquiry all the confusion. About what the history his birth this."</p>
<p>" Well that's that's right and I came back from -- if you caught during the during the campaign when I was supporting and working on by both feel abomination. I went to Kenya and I came back with the affidavit. From <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch79" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch80" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama's</b>  grandmother. On Barack Hussein Obama. That she was present at -- problem birds and Mombasa in Kenya. So -- there is a documentary evidence here of that nature which has okay what's the what's the truth. At a -- Obama's telling the truth. An investigative reporter I don't know what's on these documents all I know is that. Pop politicians rarely withhold documents that it must have information this damaging all of them. About Obama's telling the truth is very simple released the first certificate release the school records and the questions will go away."</p>
<p>" Tom Finneran -- agree it's inexplicable that he would not release them if they were around unused where exculpatory if there were up. Not damning in any way at the same time I recall during the heat of the campaign that. Hawaii in public officials. Who apparently have custody and jurisdiction over these documents said look would examine these documents these -- find is no story here -- no controversy. And what we have is proof. Positive that <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch81" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch82" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  was indeed born in Hawaii."</p>
<p>" Well the problem is that it is in the whistle floor we show what Hawaii has posted which is the modern certificate with very little information all types. Other types of birth certificates that we -- also with the birth certificate generated by the hospital would look like in 1960s it's a crystal ball for very different. A lot more information as much of the often handwritten and to perform. And I need 61 Hawaii was trying to get physical -- this state for two years at that point when Obama was born. -- state was trying to get people to register at Hawaii that they were citizens. For the stated that I took a lot of documents and even verbal -- the only the people were born in Hawaii. So we don't know what state out in the state refuses to release. The backing documents that the staked claims to have and again if <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch83" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch84" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  telling the truth by Disney authorizes state of Hawaii to release the all documents in the state of Hawaii today."</p>
<p>" And I throw can I throw up a possible explanations and IU and NC we think give -- what what if he's embarrassed by things. That he wrote or said about his nationality later that were untrue. Maybe in order to heighten his chances to be admitted to a school or for eligibility for financially maybe pretended to be a citizen of Indonesia or something like that. When in fact the the records do exist that would prove that he was born here. He might be opening up -- can of worms that there's just no reason for him to open up. And -- yet at the same time he might still be totally eligible to be president."</p>
<p>" What sort sort of a question and and the truth is not seen the documents it's impossible to really speculate with any accuracy what on the I'm an investigative reporter I just want to see the facts. And I would remind everybody that history of president stonewalling on these issues is very poor look at Richard Nixon. It was 1972 when the break in -- Watergate occurred. And Richard Nixon lied about it sort of in the third -- burglary. -- landslide election. Against George McGovern in 72 effect Massachusetts was the only state that George McGovern carried. And that it was two years later -- August. Seventy for the Nixon was resigning in disgrace after the Watergate tapes had been disclosed and he had been shown to applied. And do that involved in the burglary in the cover up. -- to the these things get worse if presidents don't just come forward with the fact that there's embarrassing facts there -- the American public would understand it. When people are questioning fundamental constitutional issues about whether Obama is a natural born citizen. Under the terms of the constitution that becomes the responsibility. Actually if you recall John McCain had questions about his. Citizenship he was born in Panama. And John McCain came forward to congress that -- the documentation. <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch85" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch86" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  refused."</p>
<p>" It's have a very odd thing in it it's a baffling thing we have a call from one of our radio callers drop from -- earlier who said that. Applications. From <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch87" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch88" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  to occidental. Had been released and then it all kinds of new information was there we've done some. Searching he said that was an AP story but there's no sign that was an AP story except on a blog so I'm suspecting that was a fraud I'm wondering if you are familiar with that story."</p>
<p>" Yes have research -- thoroughly it came out of a law that April 1 and my conclusion as it was an April fool's joke. Are there are checked with the AP there is no such story there was no release of records about the -- college that's out there on the Internet but it's simply not true."</p>
<p>" Okay thank you for clarifying that's the conclusion that Tom and I come to will -- and take some calls for a doctor accorsi 6172666868. Robin -- good morning your NW RKO withdrawn --"</p>
<p>" Good morning talk from good morning -- you know if it is amazing to me that we have a mentality. That Jarome seems to perpetuate of you know my -- your dirt work in -- and I think one of the reasons that we all elected <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch89" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch90" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  last year because wolf that it."</p>
<p>" What though what is illegitimate better about wanting to know if the president is entitled to be president."</p>
<p>" When -- was born in -- wouldn't Ubuntu is incredible all this stuff you know. It's like you know -- swift boat saying it was just a smokescreen. So you know is blocking of the Republican Party legislator and -- lackeys of the democratic."</p>
<p>" Attacking the source of this -- the story isn't attacking the story there is cause for suspicion. As to whether <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch91" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch92" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  is entitled to be president take our -- could -- what set Bobby could easily be put to rest. By the president releasing a birth certificate which doesn't seem like an unreasonable requests you agree."</p>
<p>" Iraq you know at this chart back goes I don't think you want throughout legitimized the in the claimed so I think that's part of the -- the other good thing if this. People are sick of this throw dirt on me throw -- on -- national enquirer mentality the gentleman like Jerome Kersey."</p>
<p>" Where is no dirty air Bob except that <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch93" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch94" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  refuses to offer up the most. Basic I agree explanation it just it -- his position I agree with Bob I think people absolutely sick and tired of this to -- nonsense and yet and yet. It does not take away from the point that mr. of course he's made this is fairly simply resolved if somebody says to me Tom -- we need to -- birth certificate for a BSE. Why the heck MI going to -- how many minutes when it take before you -- does not cover you know this will take red planet. Yeah when a tag line and off it just want to take long at all now -- I I. Q and I felt them but I think you might be onto something here that they're probably inconsistencies. Between the birth certificate I. I think you might be on to some pilots are tucked under reasonable let's let doctor course here respond about two."</p>
<p>" Will be in you know -- personally attack these are ad hominem attacks that don't. Without. Saying at the point I'm making I'm not a Democrat or Republican -- the constitution party members only party joined. I -- going to remind everyone that of the political aspect of this. I'll Bernstein and Woodward for the Washington Post were the darlings of the political left when they were asking. In questions about Richard Nixon should and that was the same argument. And they came out of the Republicans at that time. Saying they were these were legitimate or unfair attacks against President Nixon that shouldn't be -- Course you know again they say the district president stonewalling document is very poor. You'll also -- any any numbered and John Kennedy. Who know was completely covering up his extramarital affairs well after that summation and it all came out I mean the the historians person who are as well investigative journalist what a person as an -- Any of these discrepancies in the record the president doesn't fully disclose or explain. And it's a very simple I think the public would understand. If President Obama. A useful eighteen year old tried to use for advantage made misrepresentations. -- occidental up."</p>
<p>" Yeah -- media should I wasn't coming from a -- find -- family find -- her background and every -- every -- of financial -- is what you -- but -- the case you can certainly understand the Obama castration making the decision they you know what we installed all this thing for X number of years. Where are gonna mess around with having to sift through all those. -- only trying to."</p>
<p>" It in the end beat the record as the history is these things come out. -- having not been disclosed they become more damaging than had -- been."</p>
<p>" Understood that I think they've they've made the calculation the whatever it is they want to hide they'd rather cope with -- after he's president because this started before he was president. And they'd rather -- that after you know the Obama administration has six months to a year to do all the destructive stuff that they would never be able to do later on in his presidency. So I think they're happy to kick the can down the road Thomason what are your."</p>
<p>" We're not that produce the excellent the arm is what were clear on that its -- something's being hit. We can argue about why it's being hidden or what's being hit now that's playing -- yet but we can agree that something's being hit."</p>
<p>" That's seems fine to me although others will argue is a -- just did Thomas a western your NW RQ which -- course it."</p>
<p>" I Gloria the base idea I am the least. I think Obama is the most for. Epic president we ever had a didn't -- are popular vote for Democrat but what might chased them rumor earlier on. I'm familiar with it in the urban legend debunking web site it's no dot com. Yeah -- it are very I would not dare I only went on the -- And they have a PDF but you could download it was a scandal Hawaiian birth certificate there are you that your contention that that fraudulent."</p>
<p>" That that's not a birth -- of major army want to answer that."</p>
<p>" Yeah it's it's that the document not fraudulent the document is one that is. Are a later issued currently issued document -- distinguished. It's it's -- certificate of birth to distinguish from. The original certificate issued at a hospital. Which is a long form a lot more information. This is just the state of Hawaii affirming they have something on record in the -- records show Obama was born wife."</p>
<p>" So it's an after the fact. That facsimile."</p>
<p>" Yeah let's say it's a later generated documented fact. There's arguments made you know the only reason in the Obama administration is relying upon that document. Is clearly because they don't want to release the original it isn't the original. And it does not show the supporting documentation state of Hawaii claims to have and probably -- now. But that's supporting documentation might be -- might be the parents. Coming in -- that a <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch95" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch96" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  was born -- private investigators and went to Hawaii to. And I wanted to hospitals little problem its claim to be borders also dispute as to which hospital he was born. And neither of the hospitals. Were able to produce any records we talk privately this staff I couldn't find any records and why."</p>
<p>" What they normally be able to do that for that period of time. Was it unusual that they lack these documents."</p>
<p>" No in the documents are going to be very of the documents exist will be in the hospitals or in the state record one way or the other means stake claims to have stopped it. So there's some documentary evidence here we're just not being permitted to see it. That's part of the problem. There's even a registry that pace up and -- Honolulu newspapers of the time had a two line record. Of Obama's -- And we went directly to get a private investigator we went. To that address and no one at that address -- near that address neighbors were still living there are remembered the Obama family being at that address. There's discrepancies in the record."</p>
<p>" Doctor course a year how -- had to to understand one thing. All presidential candidates have to meet this threshold requirement of citizenship in the United States of America. How to candidates go about establishing that is it at the in the first in the nation primary in New Hampshire with a supposed to show some documentation I've never understood -- the political procedure that a candidate has to follow."</p>
<p>" Well but he -- requirements specified the constitution the constitution specifies two requirements. The person -- 35 years of age and naturally born US citizen. But there's no mechanism specified in the constitution for validating these requirements are met. So it's not -- in the constitution does it beat the Electoral College or congress or any other group or body. That's -- validate these requirements are met that's so bundle loopholes would permit this kind of an issue to --"</p>
<p>" Doctor -- course is well as we're talking about whether <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch97" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch98" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  is eligible. To service president of the United States more coming up on 68."</p>
<p>" experience for American I'm Feinberg on Boston's talks -- hey am -- W or Kerio. They light will shine down from someone. Go light a poignant. You're experienced an epiphany. Annual failure felt I have to vote for Barack. But I."</p>
<p>" Six are 7666. C six is we other ones we -- your -- doing it Teixeira of course is on -- We're talking about eligibility of <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch99" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch100" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  for the presidency a you know I've I've investigated. My inclination is not too. By and a series like this but. It's amazing the fact that it's all been stonewalled let's take some questions for Jerome -- and Wakefield -- NW RKO."</p>
<p>" truck whatever it is bigger ally is -- to that point. You know. I don't understand why a the Obama administration. -- people have not released his -- that it isn't it possible that. Granted all his information this field and is not open to the public but why couldn't they just released the birth certificate only. Just the pro whether he was born in Hawaii or not I firmly believe that the contract it was only Kenya. I really go. And I think that it -- like that leads you to believe that well -- you know from the -- information that they care in terms of interviews that were done with that are relatively is -- claim that they -- there it is part. I firmly believe that if if you look at that -- the demeanor of the -- is too much and it internationalists. As well as opposed to a traditional American there's something wrong yeah. There's something wrong with this picture."</p>
<p>" Our legislature -- wonder why you set and get into this whole notion of what the birth certificates solves because there's a question of of being a natural born citizen German we need to understand that as well."</p>
<p>" Quality and natural born citizen requirement of the constitution to be president. Alan if <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch101" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch102" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  were born and -- with his mother being under -- under -- change the way the federal statute to define he would not have been naturally born citizen under the terms of the constitution."</p>
<p>" So there's a difference of whether his mother's at the age of majority are not."</p>
<p>" Yes it would have made a difference. Because the way the federal statutes are written. If she had been and of majority agent lived in the United States for numbers years. Or nationality would have been considered to be US. And the baby with the most likely been considered the US. Naturally born even born outside the country are being underage. Is a problem given the federal statutes. In terms of my arguments here well I'm looking to get to documents and I came back I don't know were <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch103" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch104" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  was formed I came back. From Kenya with the affidavit and grandmothers saying she attended. Is birth -- is physically there when <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch105" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch106" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  was born and impossible. There was an effort made to make sure she understood what the questions -- on the very clearly explain -- several times. Which it all again that's not definitive proof it's an affidavit it's someone's wearing. I think that the issue is is an investigative reporters let's see the document let's get pretty. Documents on the table match would move the the answer further down -- If <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch107" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch108" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama's</b>  telling the truth there should be nothing to hide any of these documents."</p>
<p>" And if he's not if there is something to hide something that Blu-ray is a legitimate question about his citizenship citizenship -- accorsi. Do you actually expect that somehow or other his presidency. The legality of his presidency would be up ended in would have. Question on succession and that he would have to vacate the White House."</p>
<p>" It's a completely uncharted area constitutional law could easily could create a constitutional crisis. Other could be request coming for his resignation. They think it's big it's an unprecedented. Set of events and it's hard to predict where it would go open -- sure it would impact the American public have to be debated and decided."</p>
<p>" Susan -- NW RKO a doctor Jerome -- hi Susan."</p>
<p>" at the -- at that stick my car -- both its thank you there's one thing even if he was born in Hawaii. What about the fact that you went to Indonesia. Was adopted by the is that tomorrow. Read it is cool site as Barry -- borrow Ed -- attacked an Indonesian passport. -- I had Americans couldn't that was back in fact that. Well I'm not quite or even even it what -- Hawaii he can't be president because it'll."</p>
<p>" The me address that it's good question I've researched when <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch109" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch110" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  did go to Pakistan. And I I don't I think you could go to Pakistan at that time with the US passport I don't think it's definitive."</p>
<p>" That he had they have an Indonesian passport to travel to Pakistan when he was astute about now we need both. And that's a possibility again of the federal records we do not have recently and have been requested. Are <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch111" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch112" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  is all past or records which the State Department would have."</p>
<p>" And again. -- Obama would have had to have submitted to the State Department certain birth records in order to get a passport. So again these birth records the original birth certificate must exist. -- some form rather on that brought Obama in his autobiography. <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch113" matchId="0" eztype="kw">Dreams</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch114" matchId="0" eztype="kw">from</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch115" matchId="0" eztype="kw">my</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch116" matchId="0" eztype="kw">father</b>  says he came across his birth certificate when he was a child. So others' creative community it's got access to the question is like yet public he would."</p>
<p>" It certainly is an interest in question and a baffling one Mike in New Hampshire your next NW RKO hi Mike."</p>
<p>" Based on our good morning -- The you know."</p>
<p>" The center requirement is just an age origins and just thirty -- old."</p>
<p>" It's just an age requirement that no citizen requirement to be US senate the only citizen requirement -- aware of the constitution. It's for the president to be naturally born."</p>
<p>" In the fascinating. How a lot of big they -- and that's not."</p>
<p>" At I think you know what it -- researching the founding fathers. This derived from a concern here over the top of the revolution they history is that. Other a lot of Tories -- a lot of support pol -- the British even through the revolutionary war. And the product others felt that in the future that it wanted to have a naturally born citizen of the United States someone who did not derived from Great Britain I think that was particular concern. Opera board in the United States to be president but that requirement was not imposed on senators -- congressmen."</p>
<p>" Okay a pretty court. Mario and Wilmington welcomed at WR kill it doctor germ coursing."</p>
<p>" More -- and we are and I a couple of statements another question though don't ya. Hillary Clinton right he or she that this nomination for -- not -- Armored nation patient. I want all your act back -- we want back not because it ignored it all I need to know like district. Now the president United States. Ought to all oil it it should. Britain is at -- New York ate it up -- it ain't all it's all all. Arctic crap because both my parents or is that it little little village. Build on -- war in. Earthquake. Tragedy. -- It dark yet or that it all might have. 07 years ago and -- Eric and Eric Eric Eric -- that they are any guide America. It's about crap."</p>
<p>" Yeah I don't know that anyone saying it doesn't exist are they they're just done now whining to produce it."</p>
<p>" I think that they think assumption as does have original birth certificate from <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch117" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch118" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  does think it. I think the best one of the reasons why it's become so. Note to analyze things so difficult to understand why. <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch119" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch120" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  wouldn't just released its especially with all these requests."</p>
<p>" How are the institutions that are withholding information the the fact that this state of why is not allowing these to be released or that. The schools involved are are are they required by some kind of privacy right to hide these documents."</p>
<p>" Increasingly. Out through the past couple decades we've had a lot of privacy. Laws which prohibit. Various institutions including schools from generally releasing documents without the permission of the person. So a lot of the -- Hawaii is certainly within its rights to say that it cannot release the documents. That they -- since the original documents field must <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch121" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch122" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>.  Were to authorize the release of <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch123" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch124" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  would authorize the release of these documents. That there be no reason why all the institutions including schools or. The State Department or any other -- institution holding documents on <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch125" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch126" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  couldn't make them available. Depends upon his willingness to allow them to be seen."</p>
<p>" All right John and he enemy an accent -- New -- doctor course it."</p>
<p>" I just tuned in the and certainly not an expert on it matters like that you are. But they -- something I heard about Obama attending this child's school. And I believe it was Indonesia. And take a guess where I heard it at that I'm the only way he did and at that school was if you as a citizen of Indonesia. It I and the US to not recognize dual citizenship. So the only way he could have it and that schools that yet they'll link -- US citizenship deep you know everything about best."</p>
<p>" Yes the researcher at the early and I wrote the abomination. That to have the records from Indonesia from the two schools Obama attended. In both schools. Does the official record side that brought about what was -- Moslem and an Indonesian citizen. -- remember <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch127" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch128" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  at this time was a six to nine -- child. And what the dispute is whether his father. Who is an Indonesian citizen and a -- simply went in and -- that my son is a Moslem and Indonesia. Whether that meant that -- Obama actually renounces citizenship or got an Indonesian passport. We we don't know. And so therefore it's not definitive that <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch129" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Barack</b>  <b class="kwHighlight" id="ezSnippetMatch130" matchId="2" eztype="kw">Obama</b>  became an Indonesian citizens simply because she was registered that way by his father's school and Indonesia."</p>
