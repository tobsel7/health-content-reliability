                  <h2 align="center">Landis Completes Historic Season!</h2><br />
                  <p>OUCH Pro Cycling's Floyd Landis made history this year by returning to Professional Cycling following a hip replacement.  His Smith and Nephew Birmingham Hip Resurfacing performed greater than expected as Landis competed in over 50 races this year!  His season started at the Tour of California where he battled Lance Armstrong in the lead group on the final stage over Mount Palomar.  He raced throughout the US all year and finished his season in New Zealand where he competed in the Tour of the Southland, a brutal weeklong stage race that featured many of the World's top Professionals.<br />
                    After three years off the bike, Landis sees this season as a major success and looks forward to continued improvement next year. "I was absolutely amazed at how well my hip performed, it's like a normal joint now, no pain!  It was great to get back to bike racing and OUCH Pro Cycling was perfect for my return.  Now that I have re-established my racing fitness I look forward to next year and with my new Birmingham Hip resurfacing will set my sights even higher."</p>
                    <br /><br />
                  <h2 align="center"> Get ready for the <b><i><u>next</u></i></b> greatest comeback ever!</h2><br />
                  <p>Floyd Landis crashed on his bike in early 2003 and suffered a femoral neck fracture of his right hip.  He returned to cycling and did well until he started having more pain in the hip at then end of 2004.  His X-rays and MRI showed the evidence of a condition know as avascular necrosis, or osteonecrosis.<br />
                    This is a condition where the bone actually dies due to a lack of sufficient blood flow.  Unfortunately, this is a relatively common complication of hip and shoulder fractures because the large ball of these joints is particularly susceptible once the neck of the bone supplying the blood becomes fractured.  The fact that there was no evidence or significant problem until almost 2 years after the injury is common with osteonecrosis.<br />
                    The bigger problem develops from the irregular joint surface and subsequent degenerative arthritis, or osteoarthritis.  Floyd developed severe Osteoarthritis and due to the severe pain and disability opted for surgery.  As an alternative to traditional hip replacement surgery, Floyd had the Smith and Nephew Birmingham Hip resurfacing procedure performed on 9/27/06.  He has made a full recovery and will now attempt to return to Professional Cycling.</p>

          	<h2 align="center">OUCH Pro Cycling Team Presentation<br />
			Brent W. Kay, M.D.</h2><br />
            <p align="justify">Welcome.  I would like to start out by thanking everyone for attending our team presentation.  Most importantly I would like to thank all those individuals, sponsors and businesses that have supported Floyd and the OUCH Pro Cycling Team.  And to those courageous people who have endured the battle and kept the faith.  Without you we wouldn’t be here.  I would especially like to thank AEG and Andrew Messick for inviting OUCH to compete in the Tour of California.  This race is rapidly becoming the biggest sporting event in the world and we’re honored to be a part.<br /><br />
So how did we get here?  I met Floyd Landis late in 2002 on a training ride near my home.  This was my first year in cycling after 20 years of triathlons and a worn out shoulder joint.  Floyd completed his first Tour de France that year and was eager to get started preparing for 2003.  He was very focused on helping Lance Armstrong win his record tying 5th straight Tour de France.  After a couple rides Floyd called me January 11, 2003 as he lay on the side of the road with a broken hip.  Most people with a broken hip are transported via ambulance to the hospital, but not Floyd.  He was picked up by car and went home and took a shower before going to the hospital.  An hour later I met him at the hospital where they had put him in the hallway.  He was cracking jokes with the staff and they figured nothing was too seriously wrong.  I took a look at his hip and it was black and blue and about the size of a basketball.  He had completely fractured the ball of the hip joint off.  He was taken to surgery that night and had 3 large pins inserted to hold the fracture together.<br /><br />
You don’t do the Tour de France 6 months after a complete fracture of your hip.  That is, unless you’re Floyd.  Despite complications and a second surgery Floyd was named to the team and finished the Tour de France that year, helping Lance win his record tying 5th straight title.  He did the same thing in 2004 as Lance broke the record with his 6th Tour de France title.<br /><br />
But in November of 2004 he complained of progressive hip pain.  Diagnostic tests revealed that Floyd had developed Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip joint.  Avascular necrosis means “dead bone” is a common complication of fractures of the shoulder and hip joint.  I suffered this in my shoulder following a car accident when I was a teenager so I was well aware of the condition when I broke the news to Floyd.<br /><br />
Floyd chose to have core decompression that winter and entered the 2005 season with no training at all, in fact he was on crutches and non-weight bearing until January of that year.  We knew he would only have 1, maybe 2 years at the most following as this surgery is only palliative.  Floyd suffered terribly that year but as the season progressed his hip pain lessened as the decompression took effect.<br /><br />
He knew 2006 would be the last for his hip and he start training hard in October to prepare for his last season.  He came into 2006 in top form and won the inaugural Tour of California followed by Victories at Paris-Nice, the Tour of Georgia.  His hip joint was completely ruined by this time and he required a series of corticosteroid injection (“cortisone”) shots in the hip just prior to and during the Tour de France.  He won the Tour de France in dramatic fashion and on stage 17 made what is considered by many to be the greatest athletic comeback in all sporting history.<br /><br />
Of course everyone knows what happened from there.  Floyd underwent hip resurfacing on September 27th, 2006.<br /><br />
The Six Million Dollar Man was a television show that first aired in 1975, the year Floyd was born.  The Six Million Dollar man was an astronaut who crash landed on his return to earth, near death and clinging for life, his body was completely rebuilt with artificial parts. Pure fantasy at the time, he was dubbed the Bionic Man and as a result of his bionic body, he had unbelievable physical powers.<br /><br />
Joint replacement surgery was just starting at this time and having a joint replacement was considered extremely risky as these procedures were fraught with complications and were effectively a death sentence for many.  Only a few years after the first trip to the moon, the Bionic Man was an inspiration to millions and one of the top rated shows of the time.  The show itself inspired many scientists and physicians and joint replacement surgery surged through the 1980’s fueled by advances in surgical technique and prosthetic materials.<br /><br />
Bo Jackson, an All-Pro NFL running back and Major League Baseball All-Star developed Avascular necrosis in his hip and underwent hip replacement in the early 90’s.  He made sporting history by returning to Major League Baseball in 1993 with a prosthetic hip.  Unfortunately he ruined the hip and required several replacements after this.  To my knowledge there has been no other top Professional athlete who has attempted such a feat since.<br /><br />
That is until now.  In contrast to traditional hip replacement where the ball of the femur is removed, hip resurfacing spares much of the bone and is basically a cap on the end of the worn out bone.  Floyd has made a complete recovery, is pain free and training at peak levels.  We expect that he will not only return to the top of professional cycling but that the new hip will continue to function normally for years to come.  So enjoy the show and watch the new Bionic Man turn fantasy into reality this year.<br /><br />
Thanks again for all of your support.</p>

          <h2 align="center">What Is Sports Medicine?</h2><br />
                	<p align="justify">Sports medicine is a branch of medicine that specializes in keeping people active and healthy. It includes treating injuries, preventing and treating illness, and performing annual physical examinations.</p><br />
                <h2 align="center">What Are Some Of The Things You Can Do At OUCH?</h2><br /><br />
                	<p align="justify">We  can perform digital x-rays, splinting, casting and bracing. We do EKG's, treadmill stress, pulmonary (lung) function tests, as well as urine and strep tests.  We also perform minor/office surgeries and female exams (pap smears).</p>
                	<br /><br />
                <h2 align="center">Do You Do Regular Family Medicine/Primary Care?  Can I Use You As My Regular Doctor?</h2><br />
                	<p align="justify">Yes, our doctors are Board Certified in either Family Medicine or Internal Medicine.  Most of us have the subspecialty in Primary Care Sports Medicine.  We can take care of injuries, like an urgent care, but you can also use us as your family’s doctor.</p><br /><br />
                <h2 align="center">Can We Be Seen On The Same Day We Call?</h2><br />
                	<p align="justify">Yes, we welcome "same day” patients because the sooner we start to treat an injury or illness, the sooner it will get better.  As we say, “If you say “OUCH”, you need us!”</p><br /><br />
                <h2 align="center">Do You Perform Sports Physicals?</h2><br />
                	<p align="justify">Yes, we perform sports (pre-participation) exams on the same day.

                	<p align="justify">Yes, we are excellent for men’s health, especially for those men who have not seen a doctor for many years.  Men are reluctant to see doctors but will feel very comfortable at OUCH Sports Medicine Center. Our doctors can perform the full physical exam, including EKG’s, chest x-rays, blood testing results, and even treadmill exercise tests. Our goal is to prevent heart disease, cancer and strokes.  Men generally die 8-10 years before women and a routine annual physical is a great start to improving their health.</p><br /><br />
                <h2 align="center">Are You Orthopedic Surgeons?</h2><br />
                	<p align="justify">No, we are not surgeons. We are highly trained in most musculoskeletal injuries (ie. fractures, sprains, strains, pain, etc.) and work very closely with many of the top orthopedic surgeons in the area and southern California in general.  Most of us have spent over 10 years assisting on orthopedic surgery cases in the operating rooms.  If your injury requires a surgery, we can assist you in getting with one of these top surgeons. However, we think the “best surgery is no surgery unless you absolutely need it”. We will be able to offer you the ultimate in non surgical approaches to the treatment of your injury or pain.</p>

                  <td width="450" height="629" rowspan="2"><p align="justify">OUCH started as a funny acronym for our original medical practice; Occupational Urgent Care and Health clinic.  Unfortunately for the millions suffering with Osteoarthritis (worn out joints) the word OUCH has become a way of life.  To meet the needs of this ever growing patient population we have created the OUCH Program; Osteoarthritis Universal Care and Hope.<br />
                  Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is by far the most common type of arthritis and will affect nearly everyone at some point in their life.  In a simple sense, OA is a wear and tear process similar to the tread on a tire that wears down over time, particularly if damaged or subjected to excessive demands.  As Sports Medicine specialists, OA is a big part of our practice because it creates a tremendous amount of pain and disability, not only for athletes but for everyone.<br />
                  Most patients receive their diagnosis during an office visit with their Doctor and typically 10-15 minutes of education and then are left to fend for themselves.  The myriad of treatment options can be confusing and your Doctor may not have the time or interest in discussing these with you.  Patients are left wondering whether they really should or should not use medications, therapy, injection, splints, surgeries, imaging, supplements and the list goes on and on.<br />
                  That’s where the OUCH Program comes in.  Our half day seminars are designed to bring you the latest educational information regarding OA in a clear and concise multimedia presentation.  We explore what OA is all about and provide you with a myriad of useful information to help maximize your potential and minimize the ongoing damage of OA.  We discuss the common treatments available and talk about their potential risks and benefits.  In a nutshell we do what your regular Doctor would really like to do; spend an inordinate amount of time talking to you about your problem.<br />
                  In addition, The OUCH Program is completely independent and is designed to provide you with an unbiased look at all the treatment alternatives.  We believe that avoiding conflicts of interest frees the patient from worry that they are being sold a particular treatment.  This freedom is unique in today’s skyrocketing health care cost world.<br />
                  Created by OUCH Physician Dr. Brent Kay, the Program stems from his own personal experience with OA.  He shattered his right shoulder in a high speed motor vehicle accident as a teenager.  He spent a month in the hospital. and after 7 surgeries, the shoulder bone eventually died (avascular necrosis) and resulted in severe osteoarthritis.  Dr. Kay started swimming for rehabilitation and despite being told his arm would be useless he went on to finish the Ironman Triathlon (2.4 mile swim, 112  mile bike and 26.2 mile run) a total of 6 times!<br />
                  <br />
                  Make <i><u>your</u></i> greatest comeback ever.  Sign up for the OUCH Program this summer.</p>
