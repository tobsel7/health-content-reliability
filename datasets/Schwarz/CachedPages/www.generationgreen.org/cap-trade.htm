Cap-and-Trade?<o:p>
 </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Cap-and-trade systems, also
known as allowance trading, can be best summed up as &quot;pollution
credits.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">What happens is that overall
air quality goals are set for an area (such as the entire nation) and specific
sources of air&nbsp; pollution (such as power plants, waste incineration
facilities, etc.) are given a certain number of allowances, which represent the
amount of various pollutants that the organization or facility is allowed to
emit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Facilities that come in under
that allowable limit because of air pollution control systems can then sell
their leftover allowances to other facilities and organizations on the open
market.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">This allows the facilities that
buy up such allowances (pollution credits) to pollute more, because other
facilities are polluting less.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">In theory, the system does have
some potentially good points, by rewarding facilities that control air pollution
and providing a means for those who cannot afford the latest air pollution
technologies (or who have not completed upgrades) to buy some maneuvering room.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">A big problem with
cap-and-trade systems is that they allow for certain parts of the country to
become much more polluted than they should be. Overall air standards in the
nation might be met, but people in some parts of the country get horrible air
quality as a result, and this isn't fair...or healthy. Again, this is a problem
caused when cap-and-trade systems are left too open-ended, which is generally
the case.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Cap-and-trade regulatory models 
have been effective in decreasing emissions of certain pollutants, due to their typical 
dispersal patterns or lower toxicity. But for mercury, it's a different story. 
Because mercury emissions tend to concentrate nearer their source than do some 
other air pollutants, a cap-and-trade program may result in harm to children 
in certain communities where high mercury emissions would be allowed to continue 
or to expand. And with mercury, the risk isn't just the air pollution; it's the fact 
that the highly toxic metal settles from the air into the waterways, and ends up in the 
tissues of fish that we consume.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The cap-and-trade programs that have 
been proposed by the EPA may not address existing "hot spots" of mercury pollution and 
contamination, and may create new local hot spots for mercury, disproportionately 
impacting local communities, especially those depending on subsistence fishing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">A decade-long study sponsored 
by the EPA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the State of Florida in 2003 revealed 
that strong regulations of airborne mercury emissions produce swift, dramatic 
improvements in mercury contamination in local fish tissues. After south Florida 
waste incinerators were required to reduce their mercury emissions by 90% (they 
actually achieved 99% reduction), mercury levels in Everglades fish and wildlife 
declined by 60% in just 10 years.  This study illustrates the feasibility of these measures 
to protect public health and how strong pollution controls are an effective 
approach to cleaning up the local environment and protecting public health.
