  <p><strong><em>Agents of Change</em>: A Multidisciplinary Protocol for Assessing Climate Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation for Regional and International Markets</strong></p>
  <p>This project will focus on a protocol for assessing climate impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation, as one of many potential influences on economic activities. This research may have significance for any commodity market that is vulnerable to climate variations and change and will allow stakeholders and decision makers to better anticipate the complex consequences of change. This project is collaborative effort with scientists from Poland, Ukraine and Germany.</p>
