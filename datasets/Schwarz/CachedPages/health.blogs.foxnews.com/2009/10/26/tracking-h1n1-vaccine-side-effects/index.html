				<div class='snap_preview'><p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-759" title="dr_manny_blog2" src="http://foxnewshealth.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/dr_manny_blog2.jpg?w=101&amp;h=150" alt="dr_manny_blog2" width="101" height="150" />There has been a lot of push back when it comes to the H1N1 flu vaccine. Of course, as with any medication, there could be side effects because not all immune systems are created equal.</p>
<p>But what people have to remember is their reasons for not supporting the vaccine – mainly because of the fear that it was rushed and long-term side effects are not yet known – are some of the same reasons preliminary reports of possible side effects could also be coincidental. For example, if someone has a heart attack after receiving their H1N1 flu shot, are they going to assume it’s directly related to the vaccine or attribute it to unhealthy lifestyle decisions?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,556160,00.html" target="_blank">Associated Press recently published an article </a>on this topic that looked at how the government will be intensely tracking the side effects of this vaccine and separating legitimate medical concerns from inevitable coincidences.</p>
<p>This is a proactive plan. The government is going to be putting information together for the public in an effort to stop the spread of false rumors and try to put the public at ease.</p>
<p>One major focus will be miscarriage since they are encouraging pregnant women to get the vaccine and miscarriages are quite common anyway.</p>
<p>Like the seasonal influenza vaccine, medical professionals expect the side effects associated with the H1N1 flu vaccine should be minimal. The most common side effect with all flu vaccines is soreness at the injection site, and sometimes people feel achy.</p>
<p>Many Americans are concerned about the safety and efficacy of the newly developed H1N1 flu shot because of a similar vaccine that was linked to a swine flu-like outbreak at Fort Dix in 1976.</p>
<p>Guillain-Barre occurs naturally following upper respiratory illnesses, digestive illnesses and on rare occasions – is associated with drugs and vaccines. However, the frequency is still 1-2 per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>I’ll be keeping a close eye on this, and if anything is reported, I’ll be the first one to let you know.</p>

						<p>what do you feel caused deaths from a similar vaccine given to our military  back in the late 70&#8242;s?  my brother was part of that mandated vaccine and refused it as some in his unit had fatal results.  That is my grave concern about a rushed vaccine with that kind of history</p>

						<p>The really big story is that the FDA is sitting on an Emergency Use Authorization for intravenous peramivir.  They know it is safe and effective, as they granted it an E-IND in June.  But under that cumbersome process, the company can&#8217;t tell the ICU doctors it is available and the the ICU docs can&#8217;t get it in time, anyway.  The FDA has moved like molasses to get the EUA done and the drug into the National Stockpile.  So ICU docs watch patients on ventilators dying because they can&#8217;t oxygenate them, the viral load is so high.  This is a huge scandal, and I hope Fox News is the first to break it.</p>

						<p>I thought I heard this morning that the H1N1 vaccine is bad for pregnant women as it has long term effects on the baby.  Now, I find nothing on Fox about that.  Can you PLEASE clear this up.  My daughter is 6 months pregnant and does not know what to do!!</p>

						<p>I have read the CDC&#8217;s statements concerning the H1N1 vaccine risks of adverse reactions.  I am a RN and still having serious reservations about myself and my children receiving the vaccine.  My main concern is the unknown of what the vaccine could possilbly cause.  The nurse part of me says to vaccine because the CDC and FDA have deemed it safe.  However, the mother in me says I am not sure I want to put my children at risk of possible complications.  I know they are only possible adverse reactions, but I want to keep my kids safe.  I have educated my children on proper sneezing, coughing, and basic cold hygiene.  Maybe I&#8217;ll find some convincing info somewhere, but until then my family and I will stick with the regular old flu vaccine for the time being.</p>

						<p>The CDC stated on the news this vaccine is safe !! If that&#8217;s the case,,why is Obama saying we will have the most aggressive tracking system in place to watch for side affects??? That doesn&#8217;t make sense!!! And if the reports are to be true,,, the actual flu is not going to kill as many people as the vaccine will. WHY would the government mandate citizens to take this??????</p>

						<p>I hope the side effects of the H1N1 flu vaccine are minimal. I hope it doesn’t take too long for them to find out what the side effects are. If you do not know what the side effects are, you shouldn’t make false rumors. It is going to take some time to find the side effects but in the mean time be patient. The sooner we get the right information about the vaccine the better.</p>

						<p>I notice there is emphasis on pregnant women not receiving the flu-mist, but there is little to no discussion on whether or not those living in the household with a pregnant woman should be receiving the flu-mist.  In general those in close contact (or providing medical care) to patients with possible immune suppression are recommended to receive the injection vs. the flu-mist and it seems as though the same should apply to those in close contact with pregnant women, yet there are no notices about this.</p>

						<p>My daughter is 30 weeks pregnant. She has H1N1. She has been in the ICU for 8 days. She has pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome cause by H1N1.  They gave her steroid shots to make the baby&#8217;s lungs develop faster incase they had to deliver him early. After 8 days today is the first day she has shown any improvement.  She has been on 70% oxygen most of the time.  today its 45% oxygen.  I have no idea where she could have gotten the flu from.  It started out with a 103 fever. she went to the emergency room 11 days ago they sent her home after 1 night because her fever went away.  the next day she was back with a cough.  Thats when they realized she had pneumonia. Thats when they checked for h1n1.  The quick H1N1 test came back negative. The dr knew that that test is usually incorrect.  They gave her the better test and treated her for h1n1 anyway.  They rushed the test through the health department.  Today after 8 days in the ICU we got the results.  She does have H1N1.  What are the long term effects on the baby from the lack of oxygen and steroids and pain meds and tamiflu?  I would think the vaccine would have less side effects.  Shes still in the hospital.  Like a lot of people I thought people were over reacting about H1N1.</p>

						<p>URGENT 3 questions on H1N1 flu &#8211; </p>
<p>My son and wife both were diagnosed with H1N1 about 10 days ago.  I was also diagnosd with the same illness about 6 days ago.  We are all starting to feel better after intense periods using tamifld, fluids and bedrest.</p>
<p>Three topics for questions:</p>
<p>1. We noticed that the CDC and other information sources no longer record or report the census of who has the infection, the population counts of the spread of the flu, etc.  What happened to this reporting?  With every google search it seems like all information sources have dried up, been censored, etc.   Is this deliberate?  Is the govt holding back the truth?  From what I see on school absenteesism it appears many schools have 10-15% absentees just from the H1N1.  Why is the govt now surpressing this information given how widespread the pandamic is?  Are they trying to avoid tell everyone the truth? </p>
<p>2.  Now that my entire family has experienced the H1N1, do we need to get the vaccine?  Will the vaccine have any benefit?   If so, should we all get the vaccine?  My wife is 42 and not pregnant.  I am 49 and my son is 8 years old.  Should we get th vaccine?  Oral or spray?</p>
<p>3. Once you have caught the H1N1 can you get it again in the same season?  Next season?  What about after it mutates?  Can we get it again after it mutates?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and help.</p>
<p>Mark</p>

						<p>The H1N1 flu is simply this years newest form of flu.  The reason why they make such a big deal about the flu season is because the virus mutates so it can infect the host and reproduce.  So this year is just another strand.  I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s fine if you get it, but it shouldn&#8217;t start a panic.  I personally know many people who have been diagnosed with the swine flu, and just like most cases, it will run it&#8217;s course and you will get better.  A fun fact that apparently not everyone can fathom is that the swine flu can only cause complications of pre-existing illnesses, or lead to other problems.  Pneumonia occurs from an over abbundance of white blood cells being created(resulting in phlegm), which gets into the lungs by leaking down the trachea.  Also, a vaccine is just a weakened form of the virus.  The reason for getting the vaccine is so that your body can build up it&#8217;s own immunity to the virus.  If someone has a poor immune system, getting a vaccine is advised, but it is possible they may develop H1N1 anyways(if there body cannot handle the weakened form of the virus).  Simply put, there is a large number of people who have been diagnosed and survived.  I&#8217;m not saying not to get the vaccine, but as long as people use common sense about being sick, most should be just fine.</p>

						<p>taken directly from memo by NVAC / 24-July 2009  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/Draft2009H1N1VaccineSafetyMonitoring.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/Draft2009H1N1VaccineSafetyMonitoring.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The need to actively monitor vaccine recipients for vaccine adverse events is critical given that the vaccine candidates will all contain a new antigen and may be combined with adjuvants that are not part of licensed vaccines in the US. Relevant parties of HHS should develop appropriate procedures for linking exposure and outcome data in as large a population base as feasible, including consideration of subpopulations targeted for vaccine use. In order to do this, accurate exposure to vaccine and adjuvant type for each dose administered (with lot numbers, if possible) must be linked to outcome data. The current vaccine safety infrastructure is unlikely to be sufficient to accomplish this. Consideration should be given to the following strategies for active vaccine safety surveillance&#8221;</p>
<p>based on this assessment &#8211; Dr Manny do you think in only 3 months over gov&#8217;t bureaucracies have organised and are effectively / openly tracking any adverse events?  i&#8217;ve heard many times on all major networks that the H1N1 is made exactly as other seasonal flu shot which seems to conflict with eval by NVAC and stated in above memo???  to much conflicting info&#8230;.promises of ample supplies of vaccines then fall short not by small amounts but by 10&#8242;s of millions of doses.  does not project much confidence in my opinion</p>

						<p>Since this is a &#8220;Fair &amp; Balanced&#8221; Network, I would like to see more of natural remedies being discussed as an alternative to the Flu vaccines.  How about adequate sleep, plenty of water,eating lots of fruit and vegtables, limit sugar (which decreases the immune system).  Herbs that have a proven record to diminish flu symptoms.  Parents need to be responsible in ensuring their child&#8217;s health with not only just a flu shot, but everything that their &#8220;not&#8221; providing for good health.</p>
<p>Their isn&#8217;t a doctor on TV on any network that is stating this.  How did we all survive the flu before the shot?  </p>
<p>A Naturopathic Doctor and a TCM Doctor would be a nice adjunct to your segments.  People are going alternative routes with or without their doctor&#8217;s consent.  Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s time everyone joined forces?</p>

						<p>Recently we received a notice from our children&#8217;s school that the local Health Department would be giving the H1N1 flu vaccine to students whose parents gave their permission by signing a release form and returning it to the school. Our 9 year old sons teacher told him that he would receive the nasal H1N1 flu vaccine not the H1N1 flu shot, should I be concerned that the nasal vaccine contains a live virus. What are the risk with this form of the vaccine vs. the shot form?</p>

						<p>My son is l3 years old and is borderline asthmatic.  Our pediatrician still does not have the H1N1 flu shot available.  My son tells me that there are lots of kids absent from school and everyone around him is sick.  So far we are very healthy.  I am wondering if by the time the shot is available to us, will it be a moot point?  If we have been exposed to H1N1 wouldn&#8217;t we have developed an immunity to it?</p>

						<p>The adjuvant in the swine flu vaccine that is most concerning is SQUARLENE, which is rarely being mentioned in the news feeds.  FDA does not allow use of this adjuvant in ANY vaccines, except the recent swine flu vaccine in order to boost production quickly (make a little bit of vaccine go farther) This would appear to me to be where most of the neurological side effects could be caused. ANOTHER alarming fact missing from the news media is the contagiousness of people that have just received the swine flu mist.  They are given a live virus into their nose, but are not asked to stay home or out of public for any period of time.  The normal adverse reaction is to get a &#8220;runny nose&#8221; and &#8220;low grade fever&#8221;.  That would tell me when someone is walking around the grocery store with the post-flumist runny nose, aren&#8217;t they leaving traces of swine flu behind on items for others to contract.  Sounds to me like that is where our &#8220;pandemic&#8221; is getting a boost to spread more ramped. Consumers beware, the pharmacutical companies are not looking out for your best intereset as much as they are looking out for their bottom line profit, which will be huge after they spray enough swine flu up everyone&#8217;s nose.</p>

						<p>Doctor,<br />
I have heard numerous reports regarding the deaths associated with the H1N1 virus or complications from the virus. However, I have not heard any mention if any of the people that died from the virus or complications had received the vacination? A follow up question would be if any of the people that died had in fact been given the vacine prior to their death, what is the percentage of those deaths relating to the number of shots given?</p>

						<p>Is there a test that can determine if we already have the antibodies for H1N1? My family had a bout with a flu like illness the last week of Aug. We had high fevers, delirium of sorts, vomiting, loose stools, and body aches. We were really sick, it came on fast for the kids but I myself didn&#8217;t get sick until a week after they were well. Although we&#8217;ll get the shot when it is available wouldn&#8217;t it be a more efficient way if we identified those who didn&#8217;t need it? and vacinate only those who do? We have this big question mark over our heads, we don&#8217;t what we had, but it could&#8217;ve been H1N1. We know for sure the flu was in our area when we got sick but don&#8217;t now if we are still at risk. A close friend of the family died from H1N1 in July, she pregnant, but they delivered and saved her baby. </p>
<p>Also, I was born in 1955 from family stories I think our family had a bout with the flu in the late 50&#8242;s. When I got the flu? this last Aug I myself was sick for about a day while the rest of the family was really sick for about a week. Do antibodies in our bodies get weaker over time?</p>

						<p>I have the exact same concern as Ms. Carlise&#8230; I&#8217;m torn though&#8230; Two days ago we had the first recorded H1N1-related death of a child in Southeast Texas.  The boy was only 5-yr old and battled the complications of the disease for one month.  Then I got the release form from school yesterday.  The death of that child just came way too close to home!  I still have serious concerns about the very unknown long-term effects of the vaccine.  I believe in immunization &#8211; both my children have gotten all the recommended shots since they were born &#8211; but those vaccines have been around for long enough to understand that the risks of not getting the shots far outweigh the side effects.  This is something that can&#8217;t be told about the newly (and fast-tracked) developed H1N1 vaccine.  Should I allow for my children to be used as guinea pigs or should I take the risk of them getting sick and not be able to overcome the effects of the flu. Not sure what to do!!</p>

						<p>I too am confused&#8230;.I have 2 children and live in a small community, I seriously want to take them and hide them till this goes away. As a mother I am confused and torn, I want to protect my kids no matter what. What ifs are not going to save them, I am unsure if this Vaccine will, but I know in my heart that I will make the right desision for my family.<br />
Each person has to weigh there own reasons for getting or not getting the vaccine. It is our responsibility as parents to ensure we understand all the possible problems that can be associated with giving our children any form of drugs or vaccines. I wish life could be easy&#8230;but then we would have nothing to talk about right?<br />
All I know is I love my kids, and will keep myself informed. As for today no vaccine shot for us&#8230;. tomorrow there might be more to the story and I will take every day as it comes.</p>

						<p>I am a mother of a 3 yr old boy debating whether or not to give him the H1N1 vaccine. I want to know how anyone can say this is an epidemic on it&#8217;s way to a pandemic if HOSPTIALS WILL NOT TEST ALL FLU PATIENTS FOR H1N1. If your Dr sends you for the H1N1 test the hospital refuses and tells you the treatment is the same for seasonal flu or H1N1, so how can we be sure if we have had H1N1 or not? Also, according to the Fox H1N1 vaccine map, in my state of NJ with over 8 million residents there have been less than 240,000 vaccines shipped. Even if I were anxious to get the vaccine for my son I have very little chance of getting it. Since it is a 2 dose vaccine, how do I know I will be able to get a second dose with the shortages that have occurred so far even if I were able to get him the first? Also,if we do get H1N1 and then have the antibodies we wouldn&#8217;t need a vaccine but since we can&#8217;t know for sure through a definitve test, b/c the hospitals won&#8217;t do the test, I am then putting my son at risk for possible short term and long term side effects by giving him the vaccine. It has been reported that side effects of the vaccine are minimal. I am a Medical malpractice investigator and have seen first hand when the medical community touts safety and as time passes it turns to disaster!</p>

There is NO WAY I would put something into my body or theirs that was developed so quickly, that has not proven itself by the test of time, not to mention the questionable aspects of the governmental hype surrounding this &#8220;pandemic&#8221;.</p>

						<p>The CDC estimates that up to 30,000 serious, potentially lethal adverse reactions to the novel H1N1 vaccine are possible &#8211; think Guillain Barre syndrome which I have personally seen.  The FDA announced that a vaccine will be accepted if it creates antibodies in 4 of 10 recipients (40%), with at least 70 percent of those 4 achieving an antibody level BELIEVED to provide benefit.  Do you want to take a vaccine that may be ineffective in 7 out of 10 recipients.</p>

						<p>I see very little in the above comments about the concerns I have over the H1N1 vaccine.  All I did was a few Google searches and I found enough to keep me from allowing my 3 children to be vaccinated.  There is always the concern of mercury and other heavy metals that have been taken out of a lot of vaccines but is in this one.  My nephew has autism and I know they claim it is not caused by mercury but either way his body cannot rid itself of it.  My main concern for my family is the adjuvant (Squalene) that is being added to stretch it.  I googled the ingredients of the H1N1 vaccine and it&#8217;s in there.  It is being linked to the Gulf War Syndrome that our vets are having from being vaccinated with that ingredient for anthrax.  It causes your immune system to go haywire.  My daughter already has had problems with an autoimmune disease.  It will be years before they know the full effects of this H1N1 vaccine if they connect the dots or are willing to admit it.  Fox, please report these concerns unless it is proved without a doubt to be untrue.</p>

						<p>H1N1 vaccination side-effects</p>
<p>I received the H1N1 flu vaccination and 24 hours post injection Im feeling what I could best describe as half-flu like symptoms; dizzyness, nausea, achyness and a bit of a headache.<br />
 I hope these side-effects are the result of my body producing interferon.  Oh yeah and my arm really hurts.</p>

						<p>Earlier in the week I blogged about the H1N1 vaccine, trying to decide if my sons should receive the vaccine at school. Many people, including myself thought that because it would be cost free why not go ahead and receive the vaccine, then I started to have second thoughts. What were the risk? Would there be side effects especially to my 9 year who would receive the nasal form of the vaccine? After discussing it with our pediatrician the boys will not receive the vaccine, his reasoning is that this vaccine was hurriedly made and has not been in use long enough to know what the short or long term side effects will be. Basically anyone receiving the vaccine right now  serves as a guinea pig (my words not his). The doctor did say that in the end it is the parents chose not his. The vaccine will not be available to patients at his office if they should want the vaccine they will have to go somewhere else. I have trusted him with our three sons health for almost 15 years I will not start second guessing him now.</p>

						<p>I took SWINE FluMist.</p>
<p>I had symptoms of runny nose, slight feeling of lethargy and being run down, sneezing and a slight cough that all subsided. Of the 4 in my house that got the swine flumist I was the only one to notice anything&#8230; Its been 6 days, they say you can spread it to immuno-compromised persons for 21 days afterward. We have a two year old that did not get the mist, and he had a runny nose, sneeze and slight cough. Did he get that from us 4, I don&#8217;t know, but CDC says low chance, like .58% to 2.4%.</p>

						<p>People throughout Europe are rejecting the H1N1 vaccine en mass, despite huge campaigns by their governments to get them to take the shot when it becomes available within the next week.</p>
<p>In Germany uproar continues to grow concerning the fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and government ministers, as well as the armed forces there, will receive a special, additive-free H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The soldiers and the German government elites will receive Celvapan, an adjuvant-free vaccine manufactured by Baxter. The German public, however, will receive a vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline which contains squalene and the mercury based preservative thimerosal.</p>
<p>A report yesterday in the leading German newspaper Die Welt describes the public sentiment towards the news:<br />
That throws a treacherous light on the announcements of the German health ministry and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) responsible for vaccines. Why should the government and high-ranking officials get special treatment, the people who they rule over are asking. The dirty word of a “two-tier medicine” comes to mind. And then thoughts turn to Orwell’s novel “Animal Farm” where all are equal but “some are more equal.”</p>
<p>Polls in Germany, even before this news, have indicated that only one third of the population are interested in receiving the H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>Last week Spiegel reported that there has been an “open rebellion” by general medical professionals and child physicians in Germany over use of the toxic vaccine</p>

						<p>My 3 year old son and I got our vaccine last Friday. He was a bit crabby and I felt a little icky for a few days after, but that was the extent of it. I was very torn and it was a tough decision but I decided to do it, after doing some research. I would never forgive myself if he caught it and had to get hooked up to a machine, and fed all sorts of drugs to get over it. I thought the shot was the least risky. Made the same way as regular flu shots&#8230; I think everyone is freaking out over nothing.  Anything you do has risks, you just have to weigh the good and the bad. To me it was the logical choice, and I know I am not the only one because there were a LOT of people there. Your job as a parent is to protect your kids.</p>

						<p>The H1N1 Flu vaccine!!! Forget about it. My wife received a standard flu vaccine in November of 2005 and has been paralyzed from it for the rest of her life. Check out the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System) website and look up VAERS ID# 337622. She has been diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis. She is confined to a bed or wheelchair. Her body feels like she is encased in concrete and she suffers 24 hours per day from excutiating nerve pain. Unfortunatly there is no compensation for people who suffer from this type of vaccine injury. Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for adverse affects of their products. The Deptartment of health and human services acts as the insurance company for these manufacturers but refuse to accept responsibility. (The National Vaccine Compensation Program) Its your choice, but you are on your own!!! It is true that only 1500 people per year are affected, but if you are one of them, it&#8217;s is a big deal. Do yourself a favor and let your immune system do its job.</p>

						<p>Like Clayton, I have flu-like symptoms after getting the vaccine. I got the flu mist version with the live virus. In about 18 hours, I was starting to get a sore throat. Then it just got worse from there. I have sore throat, aches, headache, runny nose, and fever. It is like a mini-flu, bad but not as bad. I wish I had asked for the shot version which does not have the live virus. Now I am afraid to give it to my 6 year old. He has his appointment next week. I am also hoping I feel better soon.</p>

						<p>Folks, let&#8217;s stop with slamming the pharmaceutical companies, OK.  They make money, so what?  Who created this &#8220;crisis&#8221; that spurred fast-track development and approval of a vaccine?  Government officials and agencies.  Who dumped billions of taxpayer dollars into fixing the crisis? Government officials and agencies. Who fixed the reporting system to ensure that there isn&#8217;t any hard data on the actual extent of the crisis?  The government agency responsible for providing disease data.  Who will be using their &#8220;critical performance&#8221; in the face of this &#8220;crisis&#8221; to expand their requests to Congress for budgets, staff and power next year?  Yup, you guessed it&#8230;Government officials and agencies.  </p>
<p>All this government we think is &#8220;saving us&#8221; is at the root of this &#8220;crisis&#8221;, not the pharmaceutical companies.  Un-elected officials and bureaucrats declared a &#8220;crisis&#8221; based on sketchy data, so they could show all of us how neccessary they are to our continued well-being and existence on this planet.  Anyone want to bet that there will be another &#8220;crisis&#8221; next year, or that this current &#8220;crisis&#8221; will still be hanging around&#8230;?  I&#8217;m not anti-government, but I know how government agencies seem to want to grow by increasing their budgets and staff.  This is just another (really crass) example of that.</p>

						<p>My 18 year old daughter is very concerned about receiving th H1N1 vaccine.   She is concerned of the long tern effects that this could have on her body.  She wants to have children when she completes college and is concerned that this vaccine could damage her ovaries causing her to either become infertile or cause a birth defect.  I am a nurse and have taken the H1N1 without any side effects.  My daughter states that I have had my children and I do not have to worry about this.  I do not know where she got this information and I do not want to push her into getting this shot, if she becomes infertile or has a child with a birth defect I know she would blame me.  I would always question if I did the right thing.  Could you please help us make a educated decision?  Thank-you.</p>

						<p>The news is dominated by the growing numbers of indiviuals hospitalized and the numbers of adults and children resulting in fatalities attributed to the H1N1 flu. While the ages, numbers and locales are idenitified, I have yet to find how many of the patients and fatalities did or did not have the vaccine.</p>
<p>It might be very helpful in encouraging vaccination if only a small number of patients and fatalities had taken the vaccine, versus the lack of data and wondering whether those who had not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Can FOX find out what those statistics might disclose?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

						<p>My son did receive the H1N1 vaccine mist at school.  He is in special education preschool.  He has PDD-NOS.  I was conflicted about the vaccine- but was petrified of him getting sick and to the point I would not know how sick because he could not tell me.  He is showing a side effect  &#8211; that is behavioral&#8230;. but this tends to happen to him with any vaccine.  So now I wait to see how long it takes to go away.  He is usually a calm child&#8230; he was &#8220;wired&#8221;  after the vaccine.  After a few days, I have seen it get better.  Even though he was on the autism spectrum, he was usually very calm&#8230; but had verbal behaviors that he did have but had really gone away&#8230; well they are back. My son has made so much progress since his diagnosis&#8230; I am praying this is only temporary like all the other times.</p>

						<p>MY DAUGHTER WAS VACCINATED LAST WEEK AND HAS BEEN SICK EVER SINCE.  MY DAUGHTER IS IN A HIGH RISK GROUP I WAS VERY HESITANT ABOUT GETTING IT FOR HER.  I WAS TALKED INTO IT BY MY FAMILY AND HER PEDIATRICIAN.  I THINK IT MADE HER SICK, ACTUALLY I AM SURE IT DID,  THE PRESSURE TO GET VACCINES IS JUST OVER THE TOP.  IT IS SAD THAT WE FEEL SO PRESSURED TO VACCINATE OUR CHILDREN.</p>

						<p>I had the swine flu injection just over ten days ago. I have a heart valve transplant and one functioning kidney.</p>
<p>Three days later I became seriously dizzy and went to the hospital. I have experienced some vertigo since and now ten days later have a severe cold with sore throat and catarrah feeling like a flu, but no fever.</p>
<p>The hospital result was negative, but I did have palpitations.  If anyone else has had similar please comment.</p>

						<p>I have read just about everything one can on the H1N1 vaccine.  I am like alot of other parents. I am scared to have my 3 kids vaccinated. My 15 yr. old and 7yr. old have had something back in September and I took them to the doctor but the doctor DID NOT test them. I found this crazy. I was not happy with my doctor and I told him so.  They had all the symtoms of the H1N1.  In my mind they had it. So my question is, Do they even need the vaccine if they have already had it?  My oldest child is in med school and refuses to get the vaccine.</p>

						<p>Funny how my husband ALWAYS gets the flu shot even though i tell him not to, and yet HE is the one who is always sick. Isn&#8217;t it possible for all the vaccines to be a little too late? I mean doesn&#8217;t the flu virus mutate rapidly? I don&#8217;t understand why people would add more chemicals and mercury in their bodies. I refuse to get any more poisons injected in my body. People get sick and whose to say those deaths weren&#8217;t cause because of other underlying causes as well? Right?</p>

						<p>I have three children under three years of age and have thought heavily on the issue.  Yesterday all three and myself were vaccinated.  It came down to this.  All Vaccines have risks like all illnesses do.  There are a lot of misinformed people posting comments about the H1N1 variant, immunity, etc.  The major one to clarify is that the injection is a DEAD virus and cannot give you the H1N1.. it is only to spur your bodies immunological response and build antibodies.  The second is the nasal mist.  Yes its a live virus but its a weakened variant that also stimulates the immune defense but cannot be transmitted as a contagion vector.  As a father and a med student I knew that there are adverse reactions to vaccines..that is why there is a system called VAERS. Vaccine Adverse Event Record System to track them.  But they are less than 1/10th of 1%&#8230; compare that with the susceptibility of my young children getting secondary infections that could be fatal and I am willing to take the risk (which I think is way overblown) of the vaccine.  Could you live with yourself if you didnt get them vaccinated and then watched them pass away from a possibly preventable issue..one that you, even with worst of odds, could have had a better than 95% chance of preventing.  People, get vaccinated.. if not you then your children at least.</p>

						<p>3 of my family members received the H1N1 vaccine on Thursday, October 29.  3 did not.  The three of us who did receive the vaccine became sick on Monday, November 2 with sore throats and runny noses.  We have been running temperatures and are trying to fight this illness.  Could this be a side effect of the vaccine?  My daughter is wheezing terribly as I write this.  The 3 who did not receive the vaccine have not been sick at all.  I will never trust the government again.</p>

						<p>What do you mean Guillain-Barre occurs &#8216;naturally&#8217; after upper respiratory illnesses? As someone who experiences frequent upper respiratory problems and a suppressed immune system from childhood, I&#8217;m concerned about getting this vaccine for precisely these reasons as I haven&#8217;t been able to find any reassuring information that this injection will help. I feel I have just as much a chance from getting seriously ill from H1N1 than I do getting the vaccine. What to do?</p>

						<p>On Nov 10, 2009 I got the H1N1 Flu shot.  3-5 days later my left arm started aching.  That was 6 months ago.  I have gone through hell with muscle aches &amp; pains mostly with the arm that got the shot (left).  For a good time now I have limited movement in that arm and need help to do many things.  Presently, I have to sleep with an arm sling on that arm so I don&#8217;t move it quickly in my sleep which will bring on serious pain convulsions in that arm.  Can all of this be due to this flu shot?  I was on Vytorin during this time &amp; thought all my muscle pain symtoms were caused by this statin drug.  However, it is really strange that my arm pain originated right after I got the H1N1 shot!  My doctor doesn&#8217;t think the pain was caused by the statin or shot, but he doesn&#8217;t have to live with an arm that makes me feel like an invalid.  Any thoughts here?</p>
