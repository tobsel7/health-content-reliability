				<div class="content"><div class='snap_preview'><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="index.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6234" title="sulemanwebsite" src="http://weeklyworldnews.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/sulemanwebsite.jpg?w=375&amp;h=200" alt="sulemanwebsite" width="375" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">LOS ANGELES, CA &#8211; Octuplet mom Nadya Suleman launched a website to solicit donations for her family, but it was immediately hacked by a group of vigilante mothers!<span id="more-6233"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The website originally featured photos of all eight octuplets, a thank you note from Suleman, images of children&#8217;s toys and a large donation button for viewers to send money through. Suleman also provided an address where people can send items such as diapers and formula.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Suleman was perhaps not prepared for the backlash she was to receive, as the site was hacked and brought down within hours. The original homepage was left up but defaced, as seen in the screenshot below:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6235 alignnone" title="sulemanscreenshot" src="http://weeklyworldnews.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/sulemanscreenshot.jpg?w=530&amp;h=283" alt="sulemanscreenshot" width="530" height="283" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The site was tagged by the famous hacker group MOD, also known as the Mothers of Disappointment. The mysterious group has a history of attacking personal sites they disapprove of, including Britney Spears when she infamously hung dry her sons on a clothes line after a bath, and Angelina Jolie for being Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Weekly World News could not reach any members for comment, however reporters did receive a short note from an anonymous e-mail address:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>mod will not tolerate the selfish acts of bad parenting<br />
we will remain true to our mission despite any setbacks<br />
viva la maternity<br />
(call your mother, she misses you)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The site has since been restored, and Suleman&#8217;s PR representative has stated they are now taking extra security measures to arm against future attacks.</p>

			<p>I would have many children too if I were single.  I don&#039;t care if one is married or not.  My plan was always to adopt many children. Now I am married and we have 3 biological, plus more coming.  Our future plans include adoption as well.  We want a big family, and if I were single I would do exactly the same. I want at least 10.</p>

			<p>This woman is pathetic. She already has 6 kids she can&#039;t pay for now she&#039;s got 8 more. I say remove them and put them up for adoption. She expects other people to pay for her children she intentionaly had knowing full well she couldn&#039;t afford them! Go MOD!</p>

			<p>I think her children should be taken away from her for several reasons. One is not mentally well. Two she doesn&#039;t have a home of her own. Three she lives at home with her parents and SIX other kids. Four she has no job.<br />
The doctor that implanted these babies should have known these things. I feel he/she did not properly do the job. I think the license of this doctor should be pulled.<br />
There are lots of people can&#039;t have kids. Why should someone who is irresponsible and can&#039;t afford them get so many? I feel sorry for all of his children and her parents. She deserves whatever she gets. And if you are planning on donating, let me just say you are one screwed up individual.</p>

			<p>Lets examine the facts since alot of people over look them. </p>
<p>1.  She is disabled and cant work yet &quot;Received a settlement&quot;<br />
2.  She is getting a degree and has many student loans she cant afford<br />
3.  She has 6 kids already &quot;3 Receiving Disability&quot;<br />
4.  She cant adequately feed the 6 she has already by her own words<br />
5.  She receives welfare<br />
6.  She receives foodstamps<br />
7.  She got special medical assistance cause she couldnt afford medical for 6 kids.<br />
8.  She paid for treatment to have more kids while unable to feed and take care of those she already had by her &quot;OWN&quot; Admittance and words during interviews.<br />
9.  She made the concience decision to bring more kids into the world in which she couldnt support those she already had.</p>

			<p>Is there a good side to this i am missing that this woman deserves support or should get it.  Is this the example we want our daughters to follow and have people support, cause i mean honestly how many of you can support 14 children right now single with no spouse or support from the other person since technically sperm was donated.   The clinic was at fault as well but this woman needs serious help and its not by donations its mental help.</p>

			<p>Part I- I definitely think Ms. Suleman has some unresolved issues which she believes will be resolved by having numerous children.   None of us know the entire story, but   I think the entire situation is sad especially since she now has 14 children who not only need love, but medical attention, food, clothing, etc.  Can she afford that?  Obviously not,  so she is trying to make a way.  We as tax payers are upset at her for laying this burden on us, now we&#039;re upset because she is asking for donations to pay for the costs of raising her children.  We should really be upset at a system that allows a doctor who knowingly helps a woman who already has six children, is single, and doesn&#039;t have any income to get pregnant.</p>

			<p>Part II- I think is sad that her children will hear what the public is saying about their mother.   How will they be treated in public? At school?  I wish her the best &#8211; and hope that she makes millions on book deals.  Not because I agree with her &#8211; the bottom line is that she has 14 children and that money will help them have a decent life.  Hopefully she has someone in her life who is looking at what&#039;s best for the children and help her make that happen. I hope that she gets the help she needs so that she can be the best mother she can be.</p>

			<p>Who, beyond religious fanatics, cares of one is married or not? That is not the problem! In the first place, the world is already far too overpopulated and it is questionable whether we should even replace ourselves! In the second place, this woman deliberately brought lives into the world with the intention of leaning on society for their support. Her attitude is the very height of social irresponsibility, and yours isn&#039;t much better.</p>

			<p>The Biblical command of the Christian faith says, &ldquo;Be ye fruitful and multiply&rdquo;. However, as Bill Cosby has expressed in his many performances speaking of Adam and Eve, and their expulsion from Paradise, he is quoted best, &ldquo;God was angry, when God told them to do that!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Do I personally think what the Octo-Mom did was a good thing, or right? No. She already had kids she couldn&rsquo;t provide for. These are facts. It was profoundly irresponsible, and the doctor that deliberately did this for her should be investigated for any technical or ethical violations he may have committed while helping someone create a family of fourteen that she could not care for. A physician has a moral, ethical obligation not to perform procedures that will prove harmful for the public trust. </p>
<p>But, these children are here now, and if we are an ethical and morally base society, we have an obligation to render fellowship, care and compassion to these children. It is not their fault that they exist, and they should not be villified or exploited as payment for their right to exist.</p>

			<p>But the Bible also says &quot;If a man (or woman) refuses to work, they should not eat.&quot;  The principle is:  support yourself and your offspring, and don&#039;t expect to sponge off of the labors of others.  It&#039;s interesting that no one at the church that she claims to attend acknowledges knowing her or ever seeing her there.  She lied about not having cosmetic surgery, she lied about not being on public assistance &#8212; in fact, she appears to be a pathological liar!  I believe that she lied about the fertility clinic, knowing that they are bound by the dr/patient confidentiality restriction.  I believe that it would be wrong to give a dime to this woman when there are people who through no fault of their own, are destitute.  I would much rather give to The Salvation Army, Union Gospel Mission, etc., etc.  The State of California has a duty to protect these vulnerable children from this pathetic woman!  CPS should put all of her children in protective custody before the sun sets today!</p>

			<p>I have read many blogs. I have heard many questions of how and why did this happen. What could Nadya possibly be thinking of?? But I have yet to hear of any concern of this dilusional woman going off the deep end and hurting (all) her children&#8230;&#8230;I can think of, at least 3 mom&#039;s in recent history drowning their children and one just recently jailed for killing her child (and disposing of the body) in a field close to where she was living (with her parents, also).  They all went &quot;wacko&quot; with their kids, and they had only 1 or 3 or 5 to handle. Now we hear of this story of 14 kids  I truly believe this mom SHOULD NOT be allowed to take these 8 babies home from the hospital. Cildren&#039;s Services and Protective services NEED to step in, RIGHT NOW!!  If she finds she can&#039;t make enough money on this fiasco&#8230;.. she may deem them, not  important enough to keep around.  Let&#039;s all pray for these innocent babies/children!!  Signed&#8230; a very concerned citizen</p>

			<p>Do any of you agree with me that Nadya  shouldn&#039;t even want those fake French nails because of  the risk of scratching those precious, newborn babies during bathing them and other duties?   We already know she would have a quick excuse as to how she affords them, but she claims she&#039;s not being selfish. I also want to point out that if any of the naive public does support her with money donations, Nayda will surely continue fancy manicures and lip injections. She will need help for the many years to come, but people should not give Nayda the actual cash. Donations should only be in the form of prepurchased material products and food. I wouldn&#039;t trust just giving her the money to spend.  I feel so sorry for those poor, helpless babies and the noisy, hyper environment they are going home to.</p>

			<p>There is a BIG difference with the Dugger Family and Jon &amp; Kate +8 &#8211; they have jobs, homes, they are responsbile members of their respective communities and they aren&#039;t pumping the public for MONEY.  Nadya Suleman doesn&#039;t have a job, she expects people to &quot;DONATE&quot; to her, she is receiving welfare and public assistance that WE taxpayers provide and she continues to act irresponsibly.  Welfare wasn&#039;t set up to take care of its recipients for life, it was designed to help people get on their own two feet and support themselves.  Unfortunately, it is people like this woman who milk the system and continue to have children so that she can continue to collect &quot;benefits&quot;.  This was HER choice, she IS responsbile for her actions, she needs to live with the consequences.</p>

			<p>the problem with this woman is that she IS NOT WORKING!!! and WE are paying for her stupidity!!! why have children when you cannot afford them? but to go and deliberately do this is a crime against society. She was counting on us taxpayers to take care of them for her while she sits on her laurels and just bleeds the system for all its worth! If she was that concerned about her childred she woulndt have spent thousands of dollars on plastic surgery!! And I know damned well I will never regret anything I have said this hour! I dont mean just her but the rest of these people making all of these kids that they cannot afford. Its one thing to make a mistake but to do it over and over and over!! that is just plain stupid! and that includes you too &quot;mother of five&quot;. Remember these words next time you dont use protection! They way you defended her tells me you are leaching on the system as well!<br />
Have a good and God bless the working man!!!</p>

			<p>I had one child and then had my tubes tied later because I realized that I was not going to be able to afford financially to ever take care of another child&#8230;.not saying i&#039;m better than anyone else but I wish more women would be smart enough to realize that in todays world you have to be smart about bringing another child into this world. If you can afford it then more power to you. Have all the kids you want but if you cannot then you have no business doing it. I really do hope that the state does get involved with this case somehow. It&#039;s not fair to those children. I don&#039;t even care about her&#8230;I&#039;m only concerned for her kids.</p>

			<p>I guess she can stand next to you in the welfare line. It is stupid to continually produce children when you cant afford them, but hey, the taxpayer has deep pockets! I have to pay through the nose for my education and my kids, so this fool can bleed the system and get all of the goodies for free! And NO I will never regret these comments, because we the taxpayers are tired of paying for other peoples fun!! I refuse to mind my business when I am paying for the ride! and by the way you defend this bitch, you must be living off the system as well!</p>

			<p>In regards to the post above, you are totally missing the point&#8230;.ITS ABOUT SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY!!&#8230;Women can have as many children as they want, but it is their responsibility as a mother to provide for them emotionally and physically.  A mother that is unemployed and emotionally crippled from her past is not capable..where does the responsibility get passed to?  You and I whom already have bills and taxes to pay to take care of our own families.  I will not pay for a &quot;Wack Job&#039;s&quot; insane delights of having children that she can not afford.  Those children need families that can provide for them in every way.  They don&#039;t deserve this mess and the neglect that she recieved as a child will now get passed on to them&#8230;because no one person can give 14 children all the attention they need to be healthy and feel complete.</p>

			<p>I just love that language from a mother of 5-Not, wife and mother of 5!  The Dugger&#039;s can afford their 18 and they are not on welfare.  My husband and I have 7 and are in the process of adopting 2 more-from Ethiopia.  We have 3 bio and 4 adopted (at present)!  We&#039;re not on welfare or any type of assistance-as a matter of fact-we GIVE alot of assistance!  So, we&#039;re talking about night and day here.  There is no comparing Nadya and The Dugger&#039;s!  The children should be given the opportunity to be parented by a family that loves them for who they are, not what they can EARN someone!  CPS, step in, please!</p>

			<p>She does not work- she is already on public assistance, and she is depending on others to pay their way.  It is looking like it will cost taxpayers over a million dollars (granted compared to the new &quot;stimulus package&quot; that is a drop in the bucket)- but how will she afford 14 children when she doesnt&#039; work. How will she afford medical? As for the Dugger family, the father does work- he pays their way.</p>

			<p>One way or another, our society ends up supporting many of our kids, whether thorugh school taxes, public head start programs, library programs, WIC, art and music programs and on and on&#8230;..<br />
These children have been born, there is nothing we can do about that.  Let&#039;s not punish the children because of the mother&#039;s stupidity.  I don&#039;t think too many women will attempt to follow in her footsteps just to get free stuff.  Multiple births are a very dangerous undertaking.</p>

			<p>Yeah, Kathi, I agree wholeheartedly! As a matter of face one of the most well known cases happened here in NC&#8230;&#8230;.the Susan Smith drowning of her two small boys. She drove the car into the lake and then said she was carjacked. She cried on television begging for her boys to be brought back when most people were saying that she did something with them. She is still in prison and hopefully will never get out!<br />
Also folks, Dr. Phil was talking about this the other day and he was saying he would cost more to put them all in foster care than to let her keep them and pay her welfare. The first thing I noticed was her manicure and those fake lips. She didn&#039;t have those big lips in high school. And yeah I know that her being so big when she was pregnant would case swelling, but the also said on Dr. Phil that it wouldn&#039;t be in one place like that. The plastic surgeon from The Doctors said it looked like she had her nose trimmed down and cheeks raised and that she had definitely had her lips done. Not to mention, friends of hers have said she had it done 2 wks before the babies were born and that definitely is not safe!!</p>

			<p>The mother may be a greedy cow, or she may just be nuts; but how many babies are we entitled to punish because we disapprove of their mother? And how severely should we punish them? This was a cowardly act done by courageous, anonymous guardians of society.  </p>

Even a great parent will need help taking care of 14 children. I pray for God to protect all the children and mom too. It really to bad how full of hatred or self rightious people can be.</p>

			<p>Are you retarded? Really&#8230; Yes, there are children involved and they should be taken away and social services should be called. Do not bring up the Dugger family that supports their own children and doesnt get help from the government.  Nadya should be stressed because she needs to start worrying about whats going to happen to her very large family that she cant, and has not been caring for. Shes a bum, shes an attention whore PERIOD. She wants all the attention she can get whether its from the media, or from a large family. The birtHs alone for the premature octuplets is about 1.2 million. Who is paying for that? hahaha</p>

			<p>I don&#039;t agree with the in vitro process, but it happened and these kids are here. The problem is with the in viro process. Now that these children have arrived she has to do something to care for them. They are innocent children who need medical care and love. So if she needs a solution for these children to survive, then what do you expect her to do. She has to do something, or her children will die. Then how outraged would America be then if she did not get the care they needed. Think about what you would do if some of you had eight children at once. I doubt that she really anticipated having eight. The doctor who put that many babies in her was unethical. The media is manipulating this story for ratings trying to outrage America. Open your eyes how terrible are some of the poles that they have been doing about this story?</p>

			<p>The Duggars are married and were able to support their kids prior to their show. The state of California should sue Nadya for the Disablity payments she received  for the severe back injury she received. If her back injury was so bad how could she keep having babies, she was faking. Then the state should also sue for reimbursement for the medical care for the infants if she receive any kind of book deal etc and profit from them. I thought about  going to donate the .02 but if enough .02 is donate it could add up to a nice sum, so I chose not to do so. </p>

			<p>Yes we are all upset about how Nadya went about this.  Hard to believe it isn&#039;t just for the Andy Warhol 15 mins of fame.  However, I&#039;ve hardly seen any comment on the fact that she knowingly brought these children into a home w/out a father.  Just for the second set of loving hands if anything.  Yes there are wonderful women out there that couldn&#039;t help being single and did a great job raising their kids&#8230;and they would be the first to say, &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;  They know how hard it is to raise 1 child by themselves let alone more than should be possible!  All I&#039;ve heard is how Nadya wanted more kids, Nadya couldn&#039;t let those embryos alone..Nadya only wanted to be a mom,  Nadya wanted more babies, Nadya, Nadya, Nadya MEMEMEMEMEMEME!  What about how Nadya can&#039;t take care of the kids she has now, Nadya gets disability, welfare, probably WIC, foodstamps all because she CAN&#039;T do it herself, Nadya lives with her parents because she doesn&#039;t take care of her children on her own.  How in the world can she take care of  8 more disabled infants?  We are taking about doing what an army of nurses would do.  She had the kids, now she needs to take care of the kids.  Or as the popular sentiment on here is&#8230;.adopt them out, please.  How much time as a mother is she going to actually have for each child?  And that&#039;s without the spa treatments away from home.  Or giving up her precious video gaming.  It&#039;s an impossible task and I hope she sees it as thus and will want what is best for these children.  Do the math, there is no better option.  Anyway you look at it, tears are in order.</p>

			<p>I think everyone needs to back off, and quit being so judgemental.  Even if people do send money and support in the beginning, it will soon wear off, and one day she&#039;ll  be on her own, living off her parents.  If you don&#039;t agree with sending money or help, then don&#039;t.  But those children are here now, I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll figure out a way to care for them.</p>

			<p>You should take down your website.  People are very angry with you because they are trying to support themselves and do not want to support you.  What you have done is very irresponsible and makes me angry.  It does not make you a good mother.  You are using your children.  You said, &quot;You had a void,&quot;- what do you think these children will have.  Why you want us to support you is shameful.</p>

			<p>EXACTLY&#8230;&#8230;.I think she planned the whole thing to make big bucks, and that is the bottom line.  How is it she could afford the money (100,000.00 dollars) to get impregnated and yet was claiming assistance&#8230;.hmmmmm&#8230;she may be paying that back when they get done investigating her finances and false claims.   </p>
<p>It isn&#039;t fair to the taxpayers or any of her children to be in the situation she was stupid enough to put them all in.  If nobody supports her and gives her billions of dollars, then she will be forced to give the children up for adoption.   </p>

			<p>Can I just remind people that &quot;all your hard earned money&quot; is already being spent on the thousands of illegals that come over here every year and get FREE health care, FREE food, FREE housing or housing at a minimal cost. Can I also remind you that there are people born right here<br />
 in the good ole&#039; USA that are on welfare and NEVER intend to get a job.  </p>
<p>Let&#039;s talk about all those people and the fact that they are having babies, lot&#039;s of babies. I dare say in a years time we&#039;re talking THOUSANDS of them, and have I used the word FREE yet? You are already spending your &quot;good ole tax dollars&quot; on those people. It&#039;s BEING TAKEN RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER YOUR NOSE AND YOU CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT!  How about that? What Nadya Suleman could get in donations doesn&#039;t begin to touch what we spend every year on these people. </p>
<p>Do I think she made a well thought out choice? Nope, but I also see people everyday that aren&#039;t making good choices and beating the kids they &quot;have the right to have&quot; and they aren&#039;t plastered all over the evening news. Maybe since we&#039;re not &quot;really&quot; in control of our money we should look to China for all our child baring answers. Limited number, forced abortions when we reach our quota etc&#8230;  Does any of this sound as stupid to anyone else or is it just me?  It sounds about as ignorant as a lot of the posts on here. You don&#039;t HAVE to send a donation, you DON&#039;T HAVE to hit the &quot;send a donation button&quot; on Suleman&#039;s website. Matter of fact you don&#039;t even have to go to the website. That&#039;s your right, and you can  hang your hat on it. But for God&#039;s sake, let&#039;s not spread hate and anger and risk all 14 of those children being persecuted because human beings can be so cruel.  </p>
<p>If you don&#039;t think this will have an impact on them, then you are only stuck right here in this moment and really only worried about how this will effect your own life (tax $$$). There are 14 little lives out there that mean something not only to their Mother, but to a God that has made them in His image. If nothing else respect them. Keep your pockets in your pants and seek to find areas of your on lives that seem to be falling short. If you look hard enough you will find them, I promise.</p>

			<p>I feel bad for the children being brought into this world by this woman. This was very irresponsible of the mother to bring these children into this world with no means to provide for them. It is not fair that tax money is being spent on this woman to give her excellent medical services under this extreme case. Many hard working TAX paying people are loosing there homes and can&#039;t afford any sort of medical coverage at all. The children are here now theres nothing that can be done about that . However they should be adopted by parents that are financially and mentally capable.</p>

			<p>if you called it stupid money, then why don&#039;t you donate it yourself? if it&#039;s stupid money, then why is she asking for it? obviously then she doesn&#039;t need it, right? she should be in jail for child abuse, for intentionally having 8 babies, in which she already had another six small children at home, so that she can be on welfare, and asking for money from people. she is obviously incapable of taking care of them. she only having them so she can get attention and money. if she is capable of taking care of them then go ahead and do it herself. Why ask for money? take your own damn responsibilities. we work our ass off everyday to make every dollar that we make, and if any of my tax penny even go to this woman, i hope she will choke every penny back up and one day karma should take its toll on her. she should be in jail! period.</p>

			<p>The problem is she&#039;s looking for other people to care and pay for her children. You can&#039;t go ahead and have all these children when you can&#039;t feed, clothe, or take care of them. This women should be locked up in a mental institute for subjecting these children  to this life.<br />
If you want to have 14 children make sure you can take care of them first.  I think we should boycott any  movie, book deal, or reality show. I will not buy any thing from any body that encourages this woman. All she does on tv is lie about everything. This woman doesn&#039;t know how to tell the truth about anything. Nice example she is for her (victim&#039;s) oh I mean children.</p>

			<p>I&#039;m sorry people&#8230; This woman needs help in many ways. The children she had were on public assistance already. She knew she had No job, no way to care for the ones she already had. To go and do what she did was wrong in many ways. Some of the older children have health issues too. The children would be better off if they were in protective custody. The state already is paying for them. They should be adopted out . They will more than likely have health issues too. The mother is scamming everyone.</p>

			<p>Have seen a lot of &#8220;looney birds&#8221; out there..this one takes the cake. Its very obvious Nayda is NOT mentally stable. </p>
<p>The MD who did this should have his licensed pulled by the State or he she volunteer $500k of his own money yearly to take care of the kids.  The MD is also the same person who brought her other 6 kids into the world so he knows exactly what her &#8220;status&#8221; is or should have known. </p>
<p>Since I work as a RN  manager on a Psych ward and have 23 years of experience I will limit my comments to saying that this should not have happened and since it has happened. THe State of California should take step to insure that it will NOT HAPPEN again. Otherwise the taxpayers will end up with paying for situations like this. </p>
<p>Personally I would get CPS involved to get her children removed from her home until she can prove she can take care of more then  the 6 she already has. Put them up for adoption.</p>

			<p>I think it is a shame for Nayda to do what she did, knowing she has 6 children she cant take care of.  I feel sorry for all 14 of her children, they didn&#039;t ask for this!!! This situation that we are talking about is because a very selfish, and ignorant woman, who wanted to fill a void in her life for being an only child. I think she needs to be punished along with the doctor. In my own opinion I think that theirs is many couples who could do a better job than she can and the state should put that in consideration. I also think that Invitro goes against GOD!!!!!</p>

Ms. Suleman certainly did not practice eithics OR morals  when she did what she did &#8211; and it is HER fault those children exist &#8211; and since she can&#039;t take care of them, it&#039;s the STATE&#039;s obligation to take them away from her and adopt them out to families who can. When that happens, those children will exist under far better circumstances than they would have existed under their &quot;mother&#039;s&quot; (and I use quotes purposely) care.</p>

			<p>Actually,I have been thinking about that:She had 6 kids before right?So why would a single,unemployed and (possibly) homeless (she&#039;s living at her parents&#039; house) woman intentionally give birth to 8 MORE?? To have a REASON to ASK for money, and getting attention from the people and media,thus getting interviews and (someday probably) appearing on a live talk show and getting paid for it,probably getting a job and signing a contract for a reality show and making big money out of that! See this is what I think she though &quot;oh hell,i have 6 kids and can&#039;t raise them and the government thingies aren&#039;t helping much-I know: I&#039;ll get 8 more kids and the gov would have to help me more bla bla bla&quot;<br />
Well if she did it out of love,I think she should be fully responsible and work to raise her kids ALONE!! no one should work for her (today on the Oprah show,her dad came and said he is going to work much harder to be able to help raise the kids (and he&#039;s in his sixties) Aren&#039;t six kids enough dammit????</p>

			<p>i agree with you about taken them away from her there are a ton of people who want cildren but cant have them and here is is unnecessarily having children who did not ask to be in this world but are now here and what is she going to do maybe she should try to get a job. that after all is the &quot; american way&quot; right. i hate that tax paying money is going to this women when she is perfectly capable to work.</p>

			<p>Yeah she had 6 kids already but she didnt want her children to be frozen then later thrown away&#8230;Havent you people heard her reason at all&#8230; thats why an educated doctor gave HER the option this is LIFE we are talking about. Also the odds of a person actually carrying 8 babies to term even through in vitro are pretty slim&#8230;she did not plan for this..She made the right choice.She chose LIFE, honestly taxpayer money should be spent on children. and ok she has 14 children now that need assistance have you gone down to your local welfare office lately&#8230;there are more adults on assistance than children! I mean grown adults, couples with children on the way&#8230;couples with just one child. Please give it a break she should be given a fair chance&#8230; and yes  financial assistance especially from Life Hating Taxpayer&#8230; half the money is going to the government and you will never see it again anyway.</p>

			<p>Tax payers should not have to raise her children she needs to get a job and take care of the 6 other children she has and the other 8 put up for adoption,she should have thought about all this stuff going on but instead wants to bring more babies in the world without having a job or a home of her own to raise them,now she is begging for donations thats shameful and who is going to pay at the end?THE CHILDREN.she goes out spending money on stupid stuff (which she should have been saving)on nails being done,fast food,video games etc.kids need a roof over there heads food in there stomaches,etc not video games her nails done,as a single mom and a tax payer if i have to work to take care of my children then why shouldn&#039;t she have to?I ALSO WILL BOYCOTT it&#039;s not fair to any taxpayer to pay for her stupity yes they are gods creation but she did this to herself and now children are going to suffer from it.</p>

			<p>In response to my own comment, the end was a pretty silly comparison. I don&#039;t want to seem like I support Nadya and her decision in any way. I really don&#039;t understand why she couldn&#039;t just be happy with the six children that she already had. Not to mention how selfish of her to try and depend on her mother and father who are clearly tired and probably confused. I enjoy debating issues on Intense Debate but find it really sad that some people can&#039;t discuss and debate without getting so hostile and angry and calling other people names. I feel like I&#039;m in high school again. People should be able to share comments and opinions without being made fun of or told that they are an idiot or sick. Maybe instead of concerning themselves with Nadya&#039;s issues they should seek some help or anger management.</p>

			<p>You all do realize that our government throws money around like crazy on all kinds of junk.  So if we had to help out 8 babies whats so bad about that.  And im not rich by no means but I value life and those infants are here now so all you people that want to compain about it is just plain foolish.

			<p>Nadya Suleman does not deserve our support. She is a selfish woman ready to live on baby bonuses and other people&#039;s money&#8230; and be rewarded with celebrity. Is she taking us for fools? Thank God the majority of us has our eyes open and exercises good judgement.<br />
 Nadya Suleman is a bad mother and this children deserve better. I truly believe they will be more fortunate if they are adopted by loving parents.<br />
She is not a good daughter either; totally selfish and oblivious to the burden she has added to her mother. Additionaly, she has the audacity to be rude to her in an interview and tell her mother she is inflexible. Unreal! She needs to take a good look in the mirror and understand how pathetic her behaviour is.  </p>
<p>Mr. Anonymous: there is a fine line between being good and &quot;blind&quot;. You need to give yourself a good shake.</p>

			<p>LAY OFF AND HAVE A HEART!!! Stop with the outrage already and realize that these kids are here if you like it or not. So what are her options: 1. Welfare? Ask anyone on welfare and you&#039;ll find it&#039;s not a get-rich quick lifestyle. You barely get enough to get by. $400 in food stamps she received couldn&#039;t feed a family of 4. Quit whinning about the tax $ that could go to this women. You may find more change in your sofa than what might go to help this women and her kids. 2. Take the kids from her? And put them where? Foster care, adoption? What home could take all of them? Or do you want to spilt them all up? Like they will be &quot;better off&quot; seperated from their mother AND siblings. That would do more emotional trauma then good. AND why, she hasn&#039;t physically abused them. She hasn&#039;t neglected them. On what basis should they be taken away. here are plently of people who have children that cannot afford them. I&#039;ve seen families of 10 living on welfare. So what, we should sweep through communities and take all those children away too???</p>

			<p>3. The best option of all &#8211; LEAVE THEM WITH THEIR MOM and do what communities should do, HELP EACH OTHER. Albeit a HUGE MISTAKE, these kids are here and the best thing for them is to have the love and affection of their mother and connection with their biological family. That&#039;s what&#039;s best for them emotionally and psychologically. So if some company wants to help her by donating diapers, clothes or formula, so be it. LAY OFF PEOPLE AND HAVE A HEART.</p>

			<p>I don&#039;t really agree with Nadya of having 14 kids , she did not bother herself to think of how she will take care  of them . but i wonder , the guys who think about taxs and she does not desirve &#8230;.<br />
do you punish Nadya or the kids .<br />
why you did not get angry when you taxs are spent on needless melitary expens. or to solve economy crises created by group of rich guys fows is not paying any thing to solve problems. </p>
<p>wether you like it or not  taxs  you pay are spent  useless things  &#8230;. so dont worry if they spent on few babies</p>

			<p>I think that if she wanted ONE more child, it was irresponsible of her, she is jobless, lives at her parents, and is obviously not wise enough to stop using money on nails, and other unecessary items when there are six children already.  The idea alone of her wanting ONE more child is rediculous&#8230;Would it have been better for her to have had an abortion.  Or is it better for her to give her babies into adoption.  I myself think, that if she would have been in a stable relationship, in a stable home..meaning her own, she would probably not have faced so much negativaty from us.</p>

			<p>The fact the she may not be capable to handle raise these on her own, brings me to belive that the only option she has, is to keep the one extra that she wanted, and give the rest for adption&#8230;Yes, she wanted one more, she didn&#039;t know she was going to have 8, but the minute she found out, she should have decided to give them up for adoption&#8230; I don&#039;t like to judge, but my opinion is that this lady wanted to be on a reality show, because when you become pregnant the way she did,  you are bound to have more then 1 baby.  DId she want what JOHN &amp; KATE + 8 have?  That&#039;s what could have crossed her mind.  Let&#039;s hope that she becomes wise enough to choose what&#039;s best for those kids&#8230;.</p>

			<p>How can anyone in their right mind defend this woman? She has 14 children!!! I have two and that&#039;s enough!  That gives me time to enjoy both of them and actually keep my sanity!  What in the world is she going to do? Beg America for handouts through her website until these kids are 18 years old? And what about the ones that are handicap with autism?  We&#039;re already in a terrible deficit and now we have to support her and her kids??? I&#039;m not saying she&#039;s wrong for having that many kids, let me make myself clear. I&#039;m saying it&#039;s a POOR CHOICE she made when she has NO MEANS TO SUPPORT THESE KIDS! Then to look at her and KNOW that whack job had her lips AND nose done, which is so obvious! It makes people like me wonder where in the F did she get the money for that???  I don&#039;t blame them for hacking into her website! She makes a choice then expects OTHER people to pay for it??

			<p>#1&#8211;&quot;TIME&quot;:  Even if Bill Gates financially supported her, SHE wouldn&#039;t have enough TIME in a 24 hour period to take care of 14 kids each day! And I mean SHE&#039;S the one who says she wants to &#039;mother&#039; them HERSELF&#8211;so that would mean NO nannies or babysitting helpers&#8230;JUST HERSELF! How could ONE person feed/diaper/bathe EIGHT babies?? Not possible! Can you imagine 8 little ones at 18 mos old climbing and dashing everywhere at once? Oh, and don&#039;t forget she still has the other SIX! How do you read to them, kiss their boo-boos, make sure they don&#039;t touch a hot oven, teach them to tie their shoes &amp; ride a bike, help them with homework, take them to Scouts &amp; soccer, etc??? They are likely to have medical problems and developmental delays being preemies.  {see the next post #2, I got carried away!}</p>

			<p>#2&#8212;Seriously, we all want her to support her children, but what kind of job could she get that she could afford to pay for daycare for even just the 8? She couldn&#039;t even take them all to the same daycare place! They would have to be divided up; and if she was LUCKY enough to find a place that would charge her ONLY $100 a wk per child, that&#039;s $3,200 a month! (=$40,000 a year for daycare for just the 8). Who&#039;s going to cook the meals &amp; do the never-ending laundry? If she had 1 friend who helped her 2 hrs every day (well make that 8 friends 2 hrs ea day to cover 16 hrs a day) wk after wk&#8230;how many YRS will THAT go on? Friends have lives and families of their own. And her parents aren&#039;t spring chickens&#8211;don&#039;t they get to retire?  {part 2 of 3, I&#039;m a little wordy&#8230;}</p>

			<p>#3&#8212;Those precious babies need to be adopted out to loving families who have the TIME and RESOURCES to do them justice! Nadya has her hands full w/the 6 other kids already (3 of which are handicapped). The law limits how many kids can be in a daycare and a classroom, so it doesn&#039;t seem too far off to say 14 is too many for a 3-bdrm house, ya think? It&#039;s the personal attention I&#039;m afraid they will be denied, that bothers me. Oh! and one last thought: if her 14 kids all produce 14 kids, she will have 196 grandkids. Scary.  God bless all her children and I pray He puts them in the proper hands for care.  Thanks for listening. (part 3 of 3)</p>

			<p>How is that the government is not even looking into how she received welfare because she couldn&#039;t afford the 6 she had&#8230;&#8230;.but yet had the money to pay for invitro-fertilization to have more.  She did have money&#8230;.she just didn&#039;t want to use it to support her 6 children.  Any monies made off of any publicity ought to go to the State of California.  They are the ones supporting ALL 14 of her kids.  I&#039;m a single WORKING mom&#8230;&#8230;supporting my daughter without the help of government or dead-beat dad.  Why should I&#8230;as a RESPONSIBLE parent&#8230;and WORKING taxpayer&#8230;be forced to care for anymore children from IRRESPONSIBLE  .. UNEMPLOYED ..  SELFISH parents.   I&#039;m not saying we should turn our backs on these chldren because they did ask not to be born.  They are here due to stupidity.  No, stupidity is not against the law&#8230;but it can&#039;t be used as a defense either.   Meaning stupidity is no excuse.   There may not be a perfect solution to all these women having babies knowing they can&#039;t care for them.  There does need to be some point in which we say that ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.</p>

			<p>I think that she is a selfish person no mother in her right full mind would think of having another baby when she  can&#039;t provide for the six kids she all ready has.  She has issues that need to be addresed. She is craving attention and my granting her interviews and apperances on show the media is feeding into it.  I laugh when she says she does not expect the tax payers to help yet she has a website soliciting donations. I&#039;m sorry but get yourself a job and stop acting like your this wonder  mother because  as far as I think you are a mother f&#8230;ing moron. Asking for donations  which will most likely go for your manicures. GET YOURSELF A JOB AND GIVE THOSE KIDS A BETTER LIFE YOU IRRESPONSIBLE B-TCH     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

If compassion is giving the time of day to a selfish self serving ignorant woman who has brought 8 more children into this world that she is not capable of taking care of then I guess I&#039;m not compassionate or better yet a fool. Why don&#039;t you show her your compassion by helping her?  Maybe you could give her money or finance her next in vitro procedure. Why not have 6 more and make it 20? Stupid, ignorant people don&#039;t deserve compassion they deserve a kick in the head.</p>

			<p>Brainiac &#8211; the issue isn&#039;t not loving babies. The issue is self responsibility. Bringing children into this world is considered a huge responsibility. A rational person plans for it and has children accepting that it is THEIR responsibility to raise them and not anyone elses. How you can seriously consider this not a big deal is beyond me. If money is so stupid why don&#039;t you send all of yours to her then you can experience what else &quot;there is in life&quot; without the benefit of any &quot;stupid&quot; money. When you figure out that you need money to at least meet your basic needs then don&#039;t even think of applying for food stamps, medi-cal or welfare because it&#039;s only the taxpayer&#039;s &quot;stupid&quot; money that is funding those programs. I believe most taxpayers are sick and tired of supporting people on a long term basis that make foolish irresponsible decisions that don&#039;t only affect themselves but unfortunately also their defenseless children. If we had more people that thought like you we would be even worse off then we are. P.S. I&#039;ve found my soul and it doesn&#039;t have stupid, ignorant fool stamped on it. Check yours&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

			<p>Calm down everybody.  She made a mistake and now we all need to support her emotionally by praying for her.  I personally hope that some millionaires out there will help her out as maybe her kids could be our next generation of geniuses that will make her proud.  Let God take care of this situation , please.    Its not the end of the world and we need to stay positive and support her.  Dont tear her down just because  she uses welfare.  Hell, we&#039;re feeding the Taliban, remember?  And the big head honchos in government steal left and right.  Dont take out your anger on these precious little ones.  I&#039;m in agreement with Dr. Phil that this is water under the bridge and we have to stick together through this as Americans if we want our nation healed.  Hold your head high Nadya, the Lord still loves you and his love never fails.</p>

			<p>Now I&#039;d like to know one thing. How does an UNEMPLOYED mother of 14 dependents qualify to purchase a house?Now that she&#039;s admitted that her father did not purchase it. Shouldn&#039;t a lien be placed on this property since she has been recieving Food Stamps. And how is she going to make the $3000+ mortgage payment?  The outfit she was wearing as she did her walkthru on the new house wasn&#039;t cheap either over $200 purchase from Nordstrom.  I guess from this day forward it&#039;ll always feel like Christmas for Nadya. While the entire country is feeling the recession she&#039;s not. Go figure!!!</p>

He has a very good job and she does have a nursing degree so she could go back to work after the little kids go to school fulltime.  Now Nadya is a little different.  She has no job, no spousal support, no home that SHE bought herself, and no money saved up.  I do feel bad for her cause she is stupid enough to get pregnant with that many embryos knowing that she could end up with more kids than what she bargined for.  I also agree with some of the previous postings about the doctor who implanted her should help her out financially cause he is the moron that got her pregnant knowing she already does have 6 YOUNG children at home.</p>

There are alot of women in this world who aren&#039;t married and taking care of there kids and are getting help from the gov.  Open your eyes!!! She didn&#039;t choose to have 8 more kids, she wanted another one and ended up with 8. Stop being such a asshole and give the lady some credit for not aborting.</p>

			<p>I totally agree. And she&#039;s shopping for a TV reality show like Jon &amp; Kate + 8 and for bids on   the delivery room pix. Iv&#039;e heard from several ppl she got the $ from the media for interviews &amp; pix to pay the $100,000 down pmt on her house but couldn&#039;t let  welfare know, fraud issues being what they are could cause an investigation especially since her dad went on TV and said he only had $100 n the bank!  Lastly; did U see her ride home with the first two of the litter along with E-TV in the car and the paparazzi hanging all over the car and outside her house while she wasted as much time as possible making comments to the camera before deciding to call 911 and stating that she was octumom, mother of the octuplets and how she feared for her and the kids safety!!! The paparazzi do not want her kids, just pictures of them.  If she staz out of the paparazzi&#039;s way and stop&#039;s calling to let the media know her every move she won&#039;t have to fake fearing for her safety. They only know when octumom&#039;s coming out or going someplace when octumom  tells them so every chance she gets. She&#039;s a total FREAK!</p>

			<p>Dear Timber or is this Nadya????  Usually i dont respond to stupid and uneducated people as yourself but here it goes.  Taxpayers are upset and &quot;sounding off&quot; because they are tired of people like her that milk the system.  I can say though i have never seen such a person milk it to this high level.  I am upset like alot of other taxpayers and everyone has a right to give there opion, it does not matter how much they make at there job.  I pay a great deal of taxes due to the fact i am in a high tax bracket.  You see, i am a doctor.  Most people that work in fast food are teenagers and not adults.  Also your rate of $2.50 is a little off if i might add.  So for someone to sit here and blast others you sure look like a fool when you cant get your facts right.  BOO HOO back at you!!!!</p>

			<p>I think everyone should stop picking on Nadya, we dont know the whole story&#8230;&#8230;as in does anyone know if she asked the doctor to inplant all those egges &amp; if they were going to all take .then after they did what was she spose to do &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..kill some of the babies , by having the doctors remove some of them?  theonly thing she did was have bad judgement on get inplanted with egges for the seventh time.i will pray for her and her children .</p>

I think you&#039;re the one that needs to go back to school. My main concern here is those innocent lives. They do not desrve to be punished for what so many deem to be bad decision made by Suleman and her Physician. They in no way should be left on there own. Furthermore the state has no grounds or justification for removing these children and it would certainly not ease the burden of the state who would still be resposible for supporting them. Say what you will about Suleman and her rights or lack there of, but don&#039;t lose sight of the fact that young innocent lives are in the equation. Oh, and by the way, there are lots ways in which our tax dollars are spent that might not line up with everyone&#039;s viewpoint. That&#039;s the laws are set up. The babies are here now. Do you suggest they be allowed to starve. Here&#039;s a fact for the tax payers that would withold support for these childen; the percentage of the national and states&#039; budgets that is designated for welfare programs is negligible at best.</p>

			<p>alright i don&#039;t think anyone here understands why religion tells you you have to be married. A child needs both a mother AND a father to be raised properly. Having only one or the other could result in neurological problems. Having both of the same gender could also cause the brain to develop incorrectly. Both a mother and a father provide different stimulus for a child. Biologically, we need both maternal &amp; paternal influence in growth. otherwise, why would you need a man and a woman to give birth? So, i do care if you&#039;re married or not &amp; having a ton of kids.<br />
Not only do i want my future children to have the experiences they can only share with a father and with a mother, but the financial stability is far greater when there&#039;s two sources of income.</p>

			<p>On the topic of Nadia&#039;s &quot;greedyness&quot;, i would donate to her any day if it ment i&#039;d be helping her children. SHE NEEDS SUPPORT FOR HER KIDS! not donating to her would mean her kids AREN&#039;T getting the proper care they deserve, and that is completely CARELESS of you people for NOT trying to help her children.<br />
And we definitly AREN&#039;T overpopulated. over 90% of Canada isn&#039;t even inhabittedm let alone the thousands upon thousands of land in the rest of the world.<br />
People are having less than half the kids they used to be having. My mom has 4 siblings in her family, her mom has 6, yet i&#039;m an only child.<br />
The percentage of children per household now is 2.5% (HALF of what it was 50 years ago)<br />
Therefore, no overpopulation.</p>

			<p>The only reason people THINK we&#039;re getting over-populated is cuz green freaks are pushing everyone into the cities &amp; forcing them to live in tiny-ass high rise condo&#039;s for half a million dollars. since we&#039;re all squished together, it seems like there&#039;s more of us. We&#039;re also living longer thanks to medical advancements.<br />
Today, society demands a healthy, balanced lifestyle so you are taking care of your body making it healthy, which in turn makes you live longer. So really if you want to blame overpopulation on someone, you&#039;ll end up blaming it on your own social way of living.<br />
btw Kim i think you are INSANE for wanting that many children.</p>

			<p>Nadya Suleman is a fraud, a phoney and deserves to be jailed&#8230; </p>
<p>SSI is supposed to only be given to needy children.  If she got 50k from a &quot;back injury&quot;, the SSI for her children should have stopped.  Can anyone in California get off their *** and write that Austrian big-mouth, demanding to know why and how a person keeps milking the system?  Why is the fishoil sales doctor who implanted her with 20 embryos allowed to keep on practicing?  She was out from the start to make money off her children.  No caring mother would risk disability or death of their child by having a high-risk pregnancy like this.  She has made millions on photo deals, interviews and has a show starting, much like &quot;jon and kate plus 8&quot;, to exploit those freakish clones of hers.</p>

			<p>everybody wants somebody to do something&#8230;always CPS&#8230;well, we cant fix stupid; reality is that once the limelight dies down and people go back to business as usual she will ultimately be the only fool left standing with way too many children to care for; as long as there are bleeding hearts that help her financially and physically she will never be held completely responsible for her decisions; however, once the children start to gain considerable maturity and doing their own thing (illegal or otherwise) karma will kick in&#8230;be patient..what goes around comes  around&#8230;</p>

			<p>I so totally agree.  I am sick of my tax dollars going to people who seem to be serial baby factories.  It would be one thing if she started out with some means of caring for them, and I don&#039;t mean welfare.  She should be smacked and the Dr that performed the procedure at the very least needs his license suspended if not revoked.</p>

			<p>Everyone just needs to leave her alone, and stop saying she&#8217;s pathetic and stupid. &#8220;But the Bible says &#8220;If a man (or woman) refuses to work, they should not eat.&#8221; The principle is: support yourself and your offspring, and don&#8217;t expect to sponge off of the labors of others.&#8221; But what are you all doing?? Duh hello your working your ass off for people that don&#8217;t even try to get a job!! All they do is sit on there ass and do nothing all day. You have enough time to talk shit about her but not enough to talk shit about the people that do absolutely nothing all day except doing drugs all day in front or around there children?! Come on people&#8230;</p>
