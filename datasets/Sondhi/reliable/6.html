LYME DISEASE OVERVIEW
</h1>   

<p><b>
Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, 
poses a serious health crisis both nationally and internationally. 
Transmitted by the bite of a tick, Lyme disease is  
a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete (spiral shaped 
bacteria) Borrelia burgdorferi.  Lyme disease is a systemic 
infection that can affect almost any part 
of the body.  Although Lyme disease is the most well known of the 
tick-borne 
infections, multiple infections can be tranferred at one time by a single 
tick.  The presence of multiple infections tends to further complicate 
diagnosis and treatment. 
</b></p>

<p>Lyme disease is found in many countries worldwide.  
In the United States, Lyme disease has been reported from 49 states, with 
the highest prevalence in the northeastern, north-central, and Pacific 
coastal regions.  However, ticks are creaping inland as they are carried 
by travelers and migrating birds.  It is important to take proper 
precautions nation-wide to reduce the risk of contracting tick-borne 
pathogens.
</p>

<p>
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Lyme disease 
should be diagnosed clinically, which includes factors such as symptoms 
and exposure to infected ticks. Lyme disease must not be ruled out solely 
on the basis of a negative test result.  While a "bulls-eye" rash is 
diagnostic for Lyme disease, the types of rashes seen in Lyme disease vary 
greatly.  Further, a significant number of patients do not recall any rash 
or tick-bite.  Symptoms can appear quickly or develop over time.  Since 
Lyme is a  multisystem
disease, the list of symptoms is long, and it is common to see
symptoms affecting multiple systems.  Early in the illness Lyme disease
can be confused with the flu, but as the disease progresses it can lead to
cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurological, and/or other system
involvement.  Patients with chronic Lyme disease often experience severe
headaches, fatigue, pain, insomnia, and memory problems.  Chronic Lyme 
disease can render people completely disabled.
For a comprehensive list of symptoms, please see the <a
href="http://www.angelfire.com/biz/romarkaraoke/Lymekjr.html">symptom 
checklist</a>.

</p>

<p>Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics, 
either orally or intravenously.  Prompt and thorough treatment early 
in the illness is the most effective method for preventing a persistent, 
disabling condition.  There is no known  cure for chronic Lyme 
disease, and its treatment is surrounded by much controversy.  However, 
many patients find improvements when treated 
long term, either for Lyme disease bacterial infection and/or for the 
presence of co-infection. 
</p>

<p>
According to the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society 
(ILADS), "Lyme disease is the latest great imitator and should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis of MS, ALS, seizure and other 
neurologic conditions, as well as arthritis, CFS, Gulf war syndrome, ADHD, 
hypochondriasis, fibromyalgia, somatization disorder and patients with 
various difficult-to-diagnose multi-system syndromes."  Not only can Lyme 
disease be incorrectly diagnosed as other conditions, it can also occur 
concurrently with other conditions or be diagnosed incorrectly.  
Therefore, patients who suspect Lyme disease must have a full clinical 
evaluation by a knowledgeable, "Lyme Literate" physician.  The best 
referrals are obtained through local patients and support groups.

</p>

<p>In addition to Lyme disease, the following infections are 
also transmitted by ticks:  
Babesiosis, Ehrlichiosis, Bartonellosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,
Tularemia and certain viruses.  See the "other tick diseases" section for 
more information about these diseases.
