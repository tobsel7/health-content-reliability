    </span>      
        <div class="center_content"><h1 class="style2">&nbsp;</h1>
		<p>Xeroderma  pigmentosum presents many challenges for those who have the disease as  well as those who care for them. There are a number of variations  (i.e., complementation groups) of the disease itself, as well as a  range of symptom manifestations among individuals within any group.  Given the rarity of XP, it is understandable that much is not yet known  about how to best provide protection. Of necessity, we resort to  generalizations such as &quot;avoid all sources of UV radiation.&quot;</p>
          <div align="left">
            <p><a name="more" id="more"></a>We  are well aware that this is easier said than done. What to avoid? How  to protect against that which we cannot avoid? Simple questions. The  answers are not so simple. We will attempt to answer here, but rest  assured that as we learn more, the answers will improve.</p>
            <p>What  to avoid? Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is first on the list. Also, XP  patients exhibit photosensitivity, so must avoid bright visible  lighting. In addition, XP patients are susceptible to other agents  (carcinogens) that may lead to DNA damage, and are advised to avoid  these substances.</p>
            <p>For  this discussion we consider only sunlight and any other light source  capable of emitting UV. UV has the greatest potential to do harm. XP  patients are advised to avoid all light sources that are likely to be  high in UV content. The sun is the most prevalent and most significant  source of ultraviolet radiation (UV) that causes the DNA damage leading  to development of cancers.</p>
            <p>Ultraviolet  is that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths  ranging from just beyond (shorter than) violet light (thus ultraviolet)  down to the wavelengths known as x-rays. The shorter the wavelength,  the greater the energy level, and the greater the effect upon DNA. For  XP patients it is this DNA damage that is important. The XP patient  lacks the capability to repair this damage. This repair deficiency  varies, depending upon complementation group.</p>
            <p>The  longer UV wavelengths (UVA) are closer to visible light and represent  the greatest proportion of the UV reaching the surface of the earth  from the sun. The amount of UVB from the sun is much less than UVA, but  the effects upon DNA are much greater. UVC from the sun does not reach  the surface of the earth due to the protection of the ozone layer. That  this protection is changing is of much concern for everybody. Still,  the XP patient is at risk from very low levels of UV (UVB being the  most concern, but we cannot discount the effect of UVA). How low? We  don't know. That is the most important point in determining the XP  Society position with respect to protection.</p>
            <p>Since  no authority can say, with any degree of certainty, what amount of UV  is safe, the XP Society must resort to less than precise descriptive  terms. We began by stating that UV must be &quot;zero.&quot; This had its basis  in the fact that a &quot;zero&quot; reading could be achieved, using meters  available at the time, in any home by covering the windows (tinting  plus blinds or drapes) and using only low wattage incandescent  lighting. Later, as we acquired other, more sensitive, instruments we  could provide a little more direction. Using meters capable of  measuring UVA and UVB we find that this environment represents UVA+B  levels of approximately one microwatt per square centimeter or less.  These same meters would indicate 5,000 or greater microwatts per square  centimeter in direct noon sunlight in summer. Please understand that  these figures, while real, only apply if the same type and brand of  meter is used in a similar environment. We also have anecdotal evidence  that indicates that very short exposure to low levels of sunlight (full  shade in one case, sunlight through an open window at dawn in another)  caused immediate severe burning for one XP patient.</p>
            <p>The  lack of DNA repair capability is one of the defining characteristics of  XP. The effect of exposure to UV is cumulative. Thus dose (in  non-technical terms: amount of UV multiplied by time) is very  important. If we accept that the &quot;living room&quot; environment described  above is an achievable practical standard for long-term exposure, can  we accept greater exposure for shorter periods? Here necessity enters  the equation. A greater exposure to UV for a short period of time,  combined with the &quot;living room&quot; exposure for the balance of the day,  will always yield a larger dose for the full day. No matter how brief  the &quot;short&quot; exposure.</p>
            <p>Thus,  all decisions that result in greater exposure must be made in  qualitative terms. How important is the need to travel or be in a  building where the lighting is not as safe as the (protected) home? How  effective is the combination of sunscreen and protective clothing? We  expect that children with XP can and will go to school, travel to  medical appointments, and participate in other important activities.  Travel routes, time of day, use of protective sunscreen, covering the  full body with protective clothing, and face/eye protection are all  important factors. Even the best fabrics or eye coverings have a  finite, measurable degree of protection from visible and UV light.  Remember the measurements we got using our UVA+B meters? There was,  approximately, a 5,000 to one ratio of full sunlight to the &quot;safe  living room.&quot; That means that UV transmission of clothing or face/eye  protection must be 0.02% or less. Put in another way, they must block  99.98% of the UV. There also must be visible light reduction sufficient  to eliminate effects of photosensitivity. We have no data for  photosensitivity.</p>
            <p>When  we take into consideration the irreversible damage to DNA, we must be  concerned with the likelihood of accidental exposure when the patient  is outdoors. Can a glove, a face shield, a hood be easily pulled off in  normal play or other activity? What about fabric tearing? Or the  effects of fabric stretching? What about the cumulative extra dosage of  UV if outdoors for extended periods? These are among the reasons we  have cautioned against relying on protective garments for routine use  or for extended outdoor activity or for unsupervised play. When  concerns were brought to our attention by parents of children who had  such garments, we brought this to the attention of everyone through our  print and Web media.</p>
            <p>Real  concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness of certain  &quot;UV-safe&quot; garments.* While you could pay to have a photobiology  laboratory test a garment for sun protection, there remains the problem  of test interpretation: what criteria should be the basis for  conclusions? All published standards relate to sun protection for the  general population, not for the special case of the person with XP.  Still, we do recommend that people concerned about the effectiveness of  any product contact the distributor or manufacturer, in advance of  purchase, requesting test results relating to UV protection. This will  certainly aid in making informed choices.</p>
            <p>We  conclude that the purpose of the XP Society to educate and support is  better served if we provide all of this background, as well as anything  we learn from research, to families of patients so that they can make  individual, intelligent choices. We advocate maximum protection from  all sources of UV. Protective garments are but one component in the  effort to provide the best possible protection. These garments should  fit all the requirements we discuss here, to the extent possible. A  well-designed protective garment used for important transportation or  other excursions is prudent. The use of such a garment to allow a child  to play in the full sunlight is an unreasonable risk in our opinion.</p>
