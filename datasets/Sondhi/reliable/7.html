LYME DISEASE PREVENTION
</h1>
  

<p><b>
It is extremely important to take appropriate measures to protect against 
tick-borne illnesses.  Prevention strategies include repellants, tick 
checks, proper tick removal, yard care, pet prevention and an ability to 
recognize the symptoms of tick-borne diseases.  If there is one thing 
everyone can agree on when it comes to Lyme disease it is that it is best 
to prevent disease than to become ill.
</b></p>

<p>
Tick bites are painless.  It is possible to get bitten by a tick any 
season of the year, and many people are infected in their own backyards.  
Several different repellants can be used to deter ticks.  See the articles 
through our "prevention links" page for repellant recommendations (ie.
DEET, permethrin) and other tips.
</p>

<p>Regardless of the use of repellants, there is no guarantee and nothing 
beats a thorough tick check.  Tick checks should be done after any outdoor 
activities.  Thoroughly check the entire body including in the hair,  
behind the ears, behind the knees, underarms, etc.  Also check pets for 
ticks.  When it comes to tick checks, it is important to be vigilant.
</p>

<p>If a tick becomes attached, the proper way to remove it is with fine 
point tweezers.  Using the tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin 
as possible, pull the tick straight back.  Do NOT use any substances on 
the tick.  Substances cause the tick to back out on its own which 
increases the likelihood of it transmitting the infection.  
</p>

<p>Treatment of tick-bites is an individual decision and must be 
determined 
on a case-by-case basis.  Many patients advocate for their friends and 
family to receive treatment when bitten by a tick, due to 
the devastating effects of the disease and the fact that the best 
prevention of chronic disease is aggressive treatment early on.
Discuss treatment with your physician, and learn about the illness so 
you can recognize it.  
</p>

<p>While appropriate treatment of tick-bites can be 
very beneficial, Lymeinfo has serious concerns about what is commonly 
referred to as "the two doxy" approach.  
This method involves the use of 2 pills right after tick-bite to 
"prevent" disease.  However, LymeInfo's concern is that this treatment 
has the potential to knock down the germ load while not eradicating the 
infection, thereby eliminating the early, most recognizable signs of the 
disease.  We can only wonder how many patients are later diagnosed with 
other illnesses that are really Lyme disease.
</p>

<p>Learn to recognize the early signs of disease, and treat as soon as 
they develop.  Treatment is most effective in the early stages of the 
illness.  While some people in the general public have concerns about 
the use of antibiotics, in the case of Lyme disease the complexity of the 
organism NECESSITATES antibiotic therapy.  Always remember that Lyme is a 
difficult to eradicate disease that can infect every organ of the body.
</p>

<p>Although tick-borne illnesses are primarily transmitted by ticks, there 
is widening concern about the same infections being transmitted in other 
ways.  There is no human vaccine currently available to protect against 
Lyme disease.
