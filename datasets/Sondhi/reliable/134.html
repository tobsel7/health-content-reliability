<!-- BEGIN SECTION B --><p class="t7">What do I need to know about quitting? </p>
<p>The U.S. Surgeon General has said, "Smoking cessation
(stopping
smoking) represents the single most important step that smokers can
take to enhance the length and quality of their lives."
</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is not easy, but you can do it. To have the
best
chance of quitting and staying quit, you need to know what
you&rsquo;re
up against, what your options are, and where to go for help. You'll
find this information here.
</p>
<p class="t7">Why is it so hard to quit smoking?
</p>
<p>Mark Twain said, "Quitting smoking is easy. I've done it a
thousand
times." Maybe you've tried to quit, too. Why is quitting and staying
quit hard for so many people? The answer is nicotine. </p>
<p class="t8">Nicotine
</p>
<p>Nicotine is a drug found naturally in tobacco. It is as
addictive as
heroin or cocaine. Over time, a person becomes physically and
emotionally addicted to (dependent on) nicotine. Studies have shown
that smokers must deal with both the physical and psychological
(mental) dependence to quit and stay quit.
</p>
<p class="t11">How nicotine gets in, where it goes, and
how long it stays </p>
<p>When you inhale smoke, nicotine is carried deep into your
lungs.
There it is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and carried
throughout your body. Nicotine affects many parts of the body,
including your heart and blood vessels, your hormones, the way your
body uses food (your metabolism), and your brain. Nicotine can be found
in breast milk and even in mucus from the cervix of a female smoker.
During pregnancy, nicotine freely crosses the placenta and has been
found in amniotic fluid and the umbilical cord blood of newborn
infants. </p>
<p>Different factors affect how long it takes the body to remove
nicotine and its by-products. In most cases, regular smokers will still
have nicotine or its by-products, such as cotinine, in their bodies for
about 3 to 4 days after stopping. </p>
<p class="t11">How nicotine hooks smokers
</p>
<p>Nicotine causes pleasant feelings that make the smoker want to
smoke
more. It also acts as a kind of depressant by interfering with the flow
of information between nerve cells. Smokers tend to increase the number
of cigarettes they smoke as the nervous system adapts to nicotine.
This, in turn, increases the amount of nicotine in the smoker's blood.
In fact, nicotine inhaled in cigarette smoke reaches the brain faster
than drugs that enter the body through a vein (intravenously or IV).
</p>
<p>After a while, the smoker develops a tolerance to the drug.
Tolerance means that it takes more nicotine to get the same effect that
the smoker used to get from smaller amounts. This leads to an increase
in smoking over time. The smoker reaches a certain nicotine level and
then keeps smoking to maintain this level of nicotine. </p>
<p class="t11">Nicotine withdrawal symptoms can lead
quitters back to smoking
</p>
<p>When smokers try to cut back or quit, the lack of nicotine
leads to
withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal is both physical and mental.
Physically, the body reacts to the absence of nicotine. Mentally, the
smoker is faced with giving up a habit, which calls for a major change
in behavior. Both the physical and mental factors must be addressed for
the quitting process to work. </p>
<p>Those who have smoked regularly for a few weeks or longer, and
suddenly stop using tobacco or greatly reduce the amount smoked, will
have withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms usually start within a few hours of
the last cigarette and peak about 2 to 3 days later when most of the
nicotine and its by-products are out of the body. Withdrawal symptoms
can last for a few days to up to several weeks. They will get better
every day that you stay smoke-free.
</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms can include any of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>dizziness (which may only last 1 to 2 days after quitting) </li>
  <li>depression </li>
  <li>feelings of frustration, impatience, and anger </li>
  <li>anxiety </li>
  <li>irritability </li>
  <li>sleep disturbances, including having trouble falling asleep
and staying asleep, and having bad dreams or even nightmares </li>
  <li>trouble concentrating </li>
  <li>restlessness or boredom </li>
  <li>headaches </li>
  <li>tiredness </li>
  <li>increased appetite </li>
  <li>weight gain </li>
  <li>constipation and gas </li>
  <li>cough, dry mouth, sore throat, and nasal drip </li>
  <li>chest tightness </li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms can lead the smoker to start smoking cigarettes
again
to boost blood levels of nicotine back to a level where there are no
symptoms. (For information on coping with withdrawal, see the section, "<a
 href="#How_to_quit">How to quit</a>.")
</p>
<p>Smoking also makes your body get rid of some drugs faster than
usual. When you quit smoking, it may change the way your body handles
medicines. Ask your doctor if any medicines you take regularly need to
be checked or changed after you quit.
</p>
<p class="t7">Why should I quit?
</p>
<p class="t8">Your health
</p>
<p>Health concerns usually top the list of reasons people give
for
quitting smoking. This is a very real concern: Half of all smokers who
keep smoking will end up dying from a smoking-related illness. In the
U.S. alone, smoking is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 deaths, and about
8.6 million people suffer from smoking-related lung and heart diseases.
</p>
<p class="t11">Cancer
</p>
<p>Nearly everyone knows that smoking can cause lung cancer, but
few
people realize it is also a risk factor for many other kinds of cancer
too, including cancer of the mouth, voice box (larynx), throat
(pharynx), esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, cervix, stomach, and
some leukemias. </p>
<p class="t11">Lung diseases
</p>
<p>Pneumonia is included in the list of diseases known to be
caused by
smoking. Smoking also increases your risk of getting lung diseases like
emphysema and chronic bronchitis. These diseases are grouped together
under the term COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD
causes on-going (chronic) illness and disability, and worsens over time
-- sometimes becoming fatal. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis can be
found in people as young as 40, but are usually found later in life,
when the symptoms get much worse. Long-term smokers have the highest
risk of developing severe COPD. </p>
<p class="t11">Heart attacks, strokes, and blood vessel
diseases
</p>
<p>Smokers are twice as likely to die from heart attacks as are
non-smokers. And smoking is a major risk factor for peripheral vascular
disease, a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to the leg
and arm muscles. Smoking also affects the walls of the vessels that
carry blood to the brain (carotid arteries), which can cause strokes.
Men who smoke are more likely to develop erectile dysfunction
(impotence) because of blood vessel disease.
</p>
<p class="t11">Blindness and other problems
</p>
<p>Smoking causes an increased risk of macular degeneration, one
of the
most common causes of blindness in older people. It also causes
premature wrinkling of the skin, bad breath, gum and tooth problems,
bad-smelling clothes and hair, yellow fingernails.
</p>
<p class="t11">Special risks to women and babies
</p>
<p>Women have some unique risks linked to smoking. Women over 35
who
smoke and use birth control pills have a higher risk of heart attack,
stroke, and blood clots of the legs. Women who smoke are more likely to
miscarry (lose the baby) or have a lower birth-weight baby. And low
birth-weight babies are more likely to die, or have learning and
physical problems. </p>
<p class="t11">Years of life lost due to smoking
</p>
<p>Based on data collected in the late 1990s, the U.S. Centers
for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that adult male smokers
lost an average of 13.2 years of life and female smokers lost 14.5
years of life because of smoking. And given the diseases that smoking
can cause, it can steal your quality of life long before you die.
Smoking-related illness can limit your activities by making it harder
to breathe, get around, work, or play.
</p>
<p class="t11">Why quit now?
</p>
<p>No matter how old you are or how long you've smoked, quitting
can
help you live longer and be healthier. People who stop smoking before
age 50 cut their risk of dying in the next 15 years in half compared
with those who keep smoking. Ex-smokers enjoy a higher quality of life
with fewer illnesses from cold and flu viruses, better self-reported
health, and reduced rates of bronchitis and pneumonia.
</p>
<p>For decades the Surgeon General has reported the health risks
linked to smoking. In 1990, the Surgeon General concluded:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quitting smoking has major and immediate health benefits
for men
and women of all ages. These benefits apply to people who already have
smoking-related disease and those who don't.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Ex-smokers live longer than people who keep smoking. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Quitting smoking lowers the risk of lung cancer, other
cancers, heart attack, stroke, and chronic lung disease. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Women who stop smoking before pregnancy or during the first
3 to
4 months of pregnancy reduce their risk of having a low birth-weight
baby to that of women who never smoked.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The health benefits of quitting smoking are far greater
than any
risks from the small weight gain (usually less than 10 pounds) or any
emotional or psychological problems that may follow quitting.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="t8">Immediate rewards of quitting
</p>
<p>Kicking the tobacco habit offers some benefits that you'll
notice
right away and some that will develop over time. These rewards can
improve your day-to-day life a great deal:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>your breath smells better </li>
  <li>stained teeth get whiter </li>
  <li>bad smelling clothes and hair go away </li>
  <li>your yellow fingers and fingernails disappear </li>
  <li>food tastes better </li>
  <li>your sense of smell returns to normal </li>
  <li>everyday activities no longer leave you out of breath (such
as climbing stairs or light housework) </li>
</ul>
<p class="t8">Cost
</p>
<p>The prospect of better health is a major reason for quitting,
but
there are other reasons, too.
Smoking is expensive. It isn't hard to figure out how much you spend on
smoking: multiply how much money you spend on tobacco every day by 365
(days per year). The amount may surprise you. Now multiply that by the
number of years you have been using tobacco and that amount will
probably shock you. </p>
<p>Multiply the cost per year by 10 (for the next 10 years) and
ask yourself what you would rather do with that much money. </p>
<p>And this doesn't include other possible costs, such as higher
costs
for health and life insurance, and likely health care costs due to
tobacco-related problems.
</p>
<p class="t8">Social acceptance
</p>
<p>Smoking is less socially acceptable now than ever. </p>
<p>Today, almost all workplaces have some type of smoking rules.
Some
employers even prefer to hire non-smokers. Studies show smoking
employees cost businesses more because they are out sick more.
Employees who are ill more often than others can raise an employer's
need for costly short-term replacement workers. They can increase
insurance costs both for other employees and for the employer, who
often pays part of the workers' insurance premiums. Smokers in a
building also can increase the maintenance costs of keeping odors down,
since residue from cigarette smoke clings to carpets, drapes, and other
fabrics. </p>
<p>Landlords may choose not to rent to smokers since maintenance
costs
and insurance rates may rise when smokers live in buildings. </p>
<p>Friends may ask you not to smoke in their homes or cars.
Public
buildings, concerts, and even sporting events are largely smoke-free.
And more and more communities are restricting smoking in all public
places, including restaurants and bars. Like it or not, finding a place
to smoke can be a hassle. </p>
<p>Smokers may also find their prospects for dating or romantic
involvement, including marriage, are largely limited to other smokers,
who make up less than 20% of the adult population. </p>
<p class="t8">Health of others
</p>
<p>Smoking not only harms your health but it hurts the health of
those
around you. Exposure to secondhand smoke (also called environmental
tobacco smoke or passive smoking) includes exhaled smoke as well as
smoke from burning cigarettes. </p>
<p>Studies have shown that secondhand smoke causes thousands of
deaths
each year from lung cancer and heart disease in healthy non-smokers. </p>
<p>If a mother smokes, there is a higher risk of her baby
developing
asthma in childhood, especially if she smoked while she was pregnant.
Smoking is also linked to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and
low-birth weight infants. Babies and children raised in a household
where there is smoking have more ear infections, colds, bronchitis, and
other lung and breathing problems than children in non-smoking
families. Secondhand smoke can also cause eye irritation, headaches,
nausea, and dizziness.
</p>
<p class="t8">Setting an example
</p>
<p>If you have children, you probably want to set a good example
for
them. When asked, nearly all smokers say they don't want their children
to smoke. But children whose parents smoke are more likely to start
smoking themselves. You can become a good role model for them by
quitting now. </p>
<p class="t7">Help is available
</p>
<p>There are a wide range of counseling services, self-help
materials,
and medicines available today, so smokers have more tools than ever to
help them quit smoking for good. </p>
<p>Remember, tobacco addiction is both mental and physical. For
most
people, the best way to quit will be some combination of medicine, a
method to change personal habits, and emotional support. The following
sections describe these tools and how they may be helpful to you.
</p>
<p class="t7">Help with the mental part of addiction
</p>
<p>Some people are able to quit on their own, without the help of
others or the use of medicines. But for many smokers, it can be hard to
break the social and emotional ties to smoking while getting over
nicotine withdrawal symptoms at the same time. Fortunately, there are
many sources of support out there -- both formal and informal. </p>
<p class="t8">Telephone-based help to stop smoking
</p>
<p>As of 2009, all 50 states and the District of Columbia run
some type
of free telephone-based program, like the American Cancer Society's
Quitline<sup>&reg;</sup> tobacco cessation program that
links callers
with trained counselors. These specialists help plan a quit method that
fits each person's unique smoking pattern. People who use telephone
counseling are twice as likely to stop smoking as those who don't get
this type of help. Help from a counselor can keep quitters from making
many common mistakes.
</p>
<p>Telephone counseling is also easier to use than some other
support
programs. It doesn't require driving, transportation, or child care,
and it's available nights and weekends.
</p>
<p>Counselors may suggest a combination of methods including
medicines,
local classes, self-help brochures, and/or a network of family and
friends. </p>
<p>Call us to get help finding a Quitline or other phone
counseling program in your area. </p>
<p class="t8">Support of family, friends, and quit
programs
</p>
<p>Many former smokers say a support network of family and
friends was
very important during their quit attempt. Other people who may offer
support and encouragement are co-workers and your family doctor. Try to
spend time with non-smokers and ex-smokers who support your efforts to
quit.
</p>
<p>Members of support groups for quitters can be helpful, too.
Nicotine
Anonymous, for instance, is an open support group that offers a way to
find others who are quitting tobacco. It also offers a long-term
approach to quitting. (See the "<a href="#Additional_resources">Additional
resources</a>"
section for contact information.) But it is only one of many types of
support groups. Check with your employer, health insurance company, or
local hospital to find support groups. Or call the American Cancer
Society at 1-800-227-2345.
</p>
<p class="t8">What to look for in a stop smoking program
</p>
<p>Stop smoking programs are designed to help smokers recognize
and
cope with problems that come up during quitting. They also provide
support and encouragement in staying quit. Studies have shown that the
best programs will include either one-on-one or group counseling. There
is a strong link between how often and how long counseling lasts (its
intensity) and the success rate. Overall, the more intense the program,
the greater the chance of success.
</p>
<p>For example, intensity may be increased by having more or
longer
sessions or by increasing the number of weeks over which the sessions
are given. So when looking for programs, try and find one that has the
following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>each session lasts at least 15 to 30 minutes </li>
  <li>there are at least 4 sessions </li>
  <li>the program lasts at least 2 weeks -- longer is usually
better </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure the leader of the group has training in smoking
cessation. </p>
<p>Some communities have a Nicotine Anonymous group that holds
regular
meetings. This group applies the 12-step program of Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) to the addiction of smoking. This may include admitting
you are powerless over your addiction to nicotine and having a sponsor
to talk with when you are tempted to smoke. These meetings are free,
but most will take donations.
</p>
<p>Often your local American Cancer Society, American Lung
Association,
or your local health department will sponsor quit smoking classes, too.
Call us for more information.
</p>
<p>There are also some programs to watch out for. Not all
programs are ethical. Think twice about any programs that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>promise instant, easy success with no effort on your part </li>
  <li>use shots (injections) or pills, especially "secret"
ingredients </li>
  <li>charge a very high fee -- check with the Better Business
Bureau if you have doubts </li>
  <li>are not willing to give you references from people who have
used the program </li>
</ul>
<p class="t7"><a
 name="Help_with_the_physical_part_of_addiction"></a>Help
with the physical part of addiction:
Nicotine replacement therapy and other medicines
</p>
<p class="t8">Nicotine replacement therapy
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the nicotine in cigarettes leads to
actual
physical dependence. This can cause unpleasant symptoms when a person
tries to quit. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) gives you nicotine --
in the form of gums, patches, sprays, inhalers, or lozenges -- but not
the other harmful chemicals in tobacco. It can help relieve some of the
withdrawal symptoms so that you can focus on the psychological
(emotional) aspects of quitting.
</p>
<p class="t11">How nicotine replacement works
</p>
<p>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help with the difficult
withdrawal symptoms and cravings that 70% to 90% of smokers say is
their only reason for not giving up cigarettes. Using NRT reduces a
smoker's withdrawal symptoms. </p>
<p>Many smokers can quit smoking without using NRT, but most of
those
who attempt quitting cannot do it on the first try. In fact, smokers
usually need many tries -- sometimes as many as 8 to 10 -- before they
are able to quit for good. </p>
<p>Lack of success is often related to the onset of withdrawal
symptoms. And most quitters go back to smoking within the first 3
months of quitting. So don't be discouraged if you start smoking again.
Just try to stop again and make your attempt more successful by adding
another method or technique to help you quit. You can reduce withdrawal
symptoms with NRT and reduce their impact with support techniques. This
gives you a better chance of quitting and staying quit.
</p>
<p class="t11">Getting the most from nicotine replacement
</p>
<p>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) only deals with the
physical
addiction. It is not meant to be the only method used to help you quit
smoking. You should combine it with other smoking cessation methods
that help the psychological (emotional and habitual) part of smoking,
such as a stop smoking program. Studies have shown that this approach
-- pairing NRT with a program that helps to change behavior -- can
double your chances of quitting and staying quit. </p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
Clinical
Practice Guideline on Smoking Cessation in 2000 recommended NRT for all
adult smokers except pregnant women and people with heart or
circulatory diseases. But more recent data suggest that NRT
(specifically the nicotine patch) can be used safely under a doctor's
careful monitoring, even in people who have heart or blood vessel
(cardiovascular) disease. These studies have found the benefits of
quitting smoking outweigh the risks of NRT in people with
cardiovascular disease. When looking at these situations, the benefits
of quitting smoking must outweigh the potential health risks of NRT for
each person. As of mid-2009 there is still not enough good evidence one
way or the other to know if NRT is safe in pregnant women. One 2009
U.S. study found that NRT use during pregnancy led to a higher risk of
low birth weight babies and pre-term birth. Of course, these are just
some of the risks to the baby if a woman smokes while pregnant. Clearly
it is best to quit smoking before getting pregnant, but quitting in
early pregnancy can still greatly reduce the risks to the baby.
Pregnant smokers should talk with their doctors to get help in choosing
the best way for them to quit smoking. </p>
<p>The best time to start NRT is when you first quit. Many
smokers ask
if it's OK to start a program of NRT while they are still smoking. At
this time the companies that make NRT products say that they should not
be used if you are still smoking. There is some research being done
with smokers using NRT while still smoking, but it is still too early
to tell if this is dangerous to your health. The most important thing
is to make sure that you are not overdosing on nicotine, which can
affect your heart and blood circulation. It is safest to be under a
doctor's care if you wish to try smoking and using NRT while you are
tapering down your cigarette use. </p>
<p>Often smokers first try to quit on their own then decide to
try NRT
a day or more into quitting. This method does not give you the greatest
chance of success, but do not let this discourage you. There are still
many options available for quitting smoking and staying quit.
</p>
<p>Note that NRT has not yet been proven to help people who smoke
fewer
than 10 cigarettes per day. You may want to talk with your doctor about
a lower dose of NRT if you smoke less than half a pack per day but feel
you need nicotine replacement.
</p>
<p class="t11">When may I begin using nicotine replacement
therapy?
</p>
<p>You may start using NRT as soon as you throw away that last
cigarette. You do not need to wait a certain length of time to put on
the patch or start using the gum, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler. You
should double-check this information with the instructions on your
chosen method of nicotine replacement, but in general there is no need
to wait to start using NRT.
</p>
<p class="t11">How do I know if I'm a light, average, or
heavy smoker?
</p>
<p>Some NRT products make their recommendations based on what
kind of
smoker you are. But there is no formal category in any textbook or a
group that defines a light, average, or heavy smoker. In general, a
light smoker is someone who smokes less than 10 cigarettes per day.
Someone who smokes a pack a day or more is a heavy smoker. An average
smoker falls in between. </p>
<p>Sometimes a doctor will use the term <span
 style="font-style: italic;">pack year</span>
to describe how long and how much a person has smoked. A pack year is
defined as the number of packs of cigarettes a person has smoked every
day multiplied by the number of years he or she has smoked. Since 1
pack is 20 cigarettes, a person who has smoked 20 cigarettes a day for
a year is considered to have smoked 1 pack year. Someone who has smoked
30 cigarettes a day (1&frac12; packs) for 3 years has smoked 4.5
pack
years (1&frac12; x 3), and so on. This is just another way to
figure
out how high your risk of smoking-related disease might be.
</p>
<p class="t11">What are the types of nicotine replacement
therapy?
</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 5 types of
nicotine replacement therapy: </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine patches
(transdermal nicotine systems):</span>
Patches give a measured dose of nicotine through the skin. You are
weaned off nicotine by switching to lower-dose patches over a course of
weeks. Patches can be bought with or without a prescription. Many types
and different strengths are available. Package inserts describe how to
use the product, and list special considerations and possible side
effects.
</p>
<p>The 16-hour patch works well if you are a light-to-average
smoker.
It is less likely to cause side effects like skin irritation, racing
heartbeat, sleep problems, and headache. But it does not deliver
nicotine during the night, so it may not be right for those with early
morning withdrawal symptoms.
</p>
<p>The 24-hour patch provides a steady dose of nicotine, avoiding
peaks
and valleys. It helps with early morning withdrawal. But there may be
more side effects like disrupted sleep patterns and skin irritation.
</p>
<p>Depending on body size, most smokers should start using a
full-strength patch (15-22 mg of nicotine) daily for 4 weeks, and then
use a weaker patch (5-14 mg of nicotine) for another 4 weeks. The patch
should be put on in the morning on a clean, dry area of the skin
without much hair. It should be placed below the neck and above the
waist -- for example, on the upper arm or chest. The FDA recommends
using the patch for a total of 3 to 5 months. </p>
<p>Side effects are related to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the dose of nicotine </li>
  <li>the brand of patch </li>
  <li>skin characteristics (such as the person's tendency to have
a skin reaction to the patch) </li>
  <li>how long the patch is used </li>
  <li>how it is applied </li>
</ul>
<p>Some possible side effects of the nicotine patch include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>skin irritation -- redness and itching </li>
  <li>dizziness </li>
  <li>racing heartbeat </li>
  <li>sleep problems or unusual dreams </li>
  <li>headache </li>
  <li>nausea </li>
  <li>vomiting </li>
  <li>muscle aches and stiffness </li>
</ul>
<p>What to do about side effects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not smoke while you are using a patch. </li>
  <li>Try a different brand of patch if your skin becomes
irritated. </li>
  <li>Reduce the amount of nicotine by using a lower-dose patch. </li>
  <li>Sleep problems may be short-term and go away in 3 or 4
days. If
not, and you're using a 24-hour patch, try switching to a 16-hour
patch. </li>
  <li>Stop using the patch and try a different form of NRT. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine gum
(nicotine polacrilex):</span>
Nicotine gum is a fast-acting form of replacement in which nicotine is
taken in through the mucous membrane of the mouth. You can buy it over
the counter without a prescription. It comes in 2 mg and 4 mg
strengths.
</p>
<p>For best results, follow the instructions on the package
insert.
Chew the gum slowly until you note a peppery taste. Then "park" it
inside your cheek, chewing it and parking it off and on for about 20 to
30 minutes. Food and drink can affect how well the nicotine is
absorbed. You should avoid acidic foods and drinks such as coffee,
juices, and soft drinks for at least 15 minutes before and during gum
use. </p>
<p>If you smoke a pack or more per day, smoke within 30 minutes
of
waking up, or have trouble not smoking in restricted areas, you may
need to start with the higher dose (4 mg). Chew no more than 20 pieces
of gum in one day. Nicotine gum is usually recommended for 1 to 3
months, with the maximum being 6 months. Tapering the amount of gum
chewed may help you stop using it.
</p>
<p>If you have sensitive skin, you may prefer the gum to the
patch. </p>
<p>Another advantage of nicotine gum is that it allows you to
control
the nicotine doses. The gum can be chewed as needed or on a fixed
schedule during the day. The most recent research has shown that
scheduled dosing works better. A schedule of 1 to 2 pieces per hour is
common. On the other hand, with an as-needed schedule, you can chew
when you need it most -- when you have cravings. </p>
<p>Some possible side effects of nicotine gum:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bad taste </li>
  <li>throat irritation </li>
  <li>mouth sores </li>
  <li>hiccups </li>
  <li>nausea </li>
  <li>jaw discomfort </li>
  <li>racing heartbeat </li>
</ul>
<p>The gum can also damage dentures and dental work.
</p>
<p>Symptoms related to the stomach and jaw are usually caused by
improper use of the gum, such as swallowing the nicotine or chewing too
fast. </p>
<p>Long-term dependence is one possible disadvantage of nicotine
gum.
In fact, research has shown that 15% to 20% of gum users who are able
to quit smoking keep using the gum for a year or longer. Although the
maximum recommended length of use is 6 months, continuing to use the
gum is probably safer than going back to smoking. But since there is
little research on the health effects of long-term nicotine gum use,
most health care providers still recommend limiting its use to 6
months.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine nasal
spray: </span>The
nasal spray delivers nicotine to the bloodstream as it is quickly
absorbed through the nose. It is available only by prescription.
</p>
<p>The nasal spray relieves withdrawal symptoms very quickly and
lets
you control your nicotine cravings. Smokers usually like the nasal
spray because it is easy to use. But the FDA warns users that since
this product contains nicotine, it can allow the addiction to continue.
The FDA recommends that the spray be prescribed for 3-month periods and
that it not be used for longer than 6 months.
</p>
<p>The most common side effects last about 1 to 2 weeks and can
include the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>nasal irritation </li>
  <li>runny nose </li>
  <li>watery eyes </li>
  <li>sneezing </li>
  <li>throat irritation </li>
  <li>coughing </li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the danger of using more than is needed. If you
have
asthma, allergies, nasal polyps, or sinus problems, your doctor may
suggest another form of NRT. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine
inhalers:</span> Inhalers
are available only by prescription. The nicotine inhaler is a thin
plastic tube with a nicotine cartridge inside. When you take a puff
from the inhaler, the cartridge puts out a nicotine vapor. Unlike other
inhalers, which deliver most of the medicine to the lungs, the nicotine
inhaler delivers most of the nicotine vapor to the mouth. Nicotine
inhalers are the FDA-approved nicotine replacement method that is most
like smoking a cigarette, which some smokers find helpful. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is between 6 and 16 cartridges a day, for
up to 6 months.
</p>
<p>The most common side effects, especially when first using the
inhaler, include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>coughing </li>
  <li>throat irritation </li>
  <li>upset stomach </li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, inhalers are the most expensive forms of NRT
available. They are not the same as electronic cigarettes, which have
not been proven in clinical trials to help with quitting and are not
approved by the FDA. (See section, "<a
 href="#Other_nicotine_and_tobacco_products_not">Other
nicotine and tobacco products not reviewed or approved by the FDA</a>.")
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicotine
lozenges: </span>Nicotine-containing
lozenges as an over-the-counter aid to stop smoking are the newest form
of NRT on the market. As with nicotine gum, the lozenge is available in
2 strengths: 2 mg and 4 mg. Smokers choose their dose based on how long
after waking up they normally have their first cigarette. </p>
<p>The lozenge manufacturer recommends using it as part of a
12-week
program. The recommended dose is 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours for 6
weeks, then 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours for weeks 7 to 9, and finally,
1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours for weeks 10 to 12. The manufacturer also
recommends the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stop all smoking when you begin to use the lozenge. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not eat or drink for 15 minutes before using the
lozenge. (Some drinks can reduce how well the lozenge works.) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Suck on the lozenge until it is fully dissolved, about 20
to 30
minutes. Do not bite or chew it like a hard candy, and do not swallow
it. The medicine is taken in through the tissues of the mouth.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours, or more than 20
lozenges total per day. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Stop using the lozenge after 12 weeks. If you still feel
you need to use the lozenge, talk to your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not use the lozenge if you keep smoking, chewing
tobacco,
using snuff, or use any other product containing nicotine (such as the
nicotine patch or nicotine gum).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Possible side effects of the nicotine lozenge include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>trouble sleeping </li>
  <li>nausea </li>
  <li>hiccups </li>
  <li>coughing </li>
  <li>heartburn </li>
  <li>headache </li>
  <li>flatulence (gas) </li>
</ul>
<p class="t11">Which type of nicotine replacement may be
right for you?
</p>
<p>There's no evidence that any one type of nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT) is any better than another. When choosing which type of
NRT you will use, think about which method will best fit your lifestyle
and pattern of smoking. Do you want/need something to chew or occupy
your hands? Or are you looking for once-a-day convenience?
</p>
<p>Some important points to think about: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Nicotine gums, lozenges, and inhalers are substitutes you
can put
into your mouth that allow you to control your dosage to help keep
cravings under better control.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Nicotine gums and lozenges are generally sugar-free, but if
you are diabetic and have any doubts, check with the manufacturer. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Nicotine nasal spray works very quickly when you need it. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Nicotine inhalers allow you to mimic the use of cigarettes
by puffing and holding the inhaler. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Nicotine patches are convenient and only have to be put on
once a day. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Both inhalers and nasal sprays require a doctor's
prescription. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Some people may not be able to use patches, inhalers, or
nasal sprays because of allergies or other conditions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever type you use, take your NRT at the recommended dose,
and
for as long as it is recommended. If you use a different dose or stop
taking it too soon, it can't be expected to work like it should. If you
are a very heavy smoker or a very light smoker, you may want to talk
with your doctor about whether your NRT dose should be changed to
better suit your needs.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combining the
patch and other nicotine replacement products: </span>Using
the nicotine patch along with shorter-acting products such as the gum,
lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler is another method of NRT. The idea is
to get a steady dose of nicotine with the patch and to use one of the
shorter-acting products when you have strong cravings. </p>
<p>The few studies that have been done on combination NRT used in
the
way described above have found that it may work better than a single
product. Still, more research is needed to prove this and to find safe
and effective doses. And the combined use of NRT products has not yet
been approved by the FDA. If you are thinking about using more than one
NRT product, be sure to talk it over with your doctor first. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">High-dose
nicotine replacement therapy for heavy smokers: </span>Another
NRT option is to give smokers a higher dose based on the amount of
nicotine that they have been getting from cigarettes. Sometimes this
method has required larger doses of NRT than have been used before.
High-dose NRT with patches has been studied with patients getting from
35 mg to 63 mg of nicotine per day. The research suggests that
patients' withdrawal symptoms go away with these higher doses and their
cravings improve without harmful effects on the heart and circulation.
Patient were carefully watched in these studies to make sure they were
doing well and were not becoming ill or having any problems. But not
much is known about this option and it should be considered only with a
doctor's guidance and supervision.
</p>
<p class="t11">Stopping nicotine replacement therapy
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, most forms of NRT are meant to be used
for
limited periods of time. Use should be tapered down to a low dose
before NRT is stopped. Research is still being done to refine the use
of NRT. For example, even though the patch is usually used for 3 to 5
months, some studies have suggested that using it for 8 weeks or less
works just as well. But other researchers have noted that the risk of
relapse goes up when nicotine replacement is stopped, even after it has
been used for 5 months. These differences have not been fully
explained. More studies are needed to learn which smokers are likely to
be successful using shorter or longer NRT than usual. If you feel that
you need NRT for a different length of time than is recommended, it is
best to discuss this with your doctor.
</p>
<p class="t8">Bupropion (Zyban<sup>&reg;</sup>)
</p>
<p>Bupropion (Zyban<sup>&reg;</sup>) is a
prescription anti-depressant
in an extended-release form that reduces symptoms of nicotine
withdrawal. It does not contain nicotine. This drug acts on chemicals
in the brain that are related to nicotine craving. It can be used alone
or together with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Bupropion works
best if it is started 1 or 2 weeks before you quit smoking. The usual
dosage is one or two 150 mg tablets per day. </p>
<p>This drug should not be taken if you have ever had seizures,
heavy
alcohol use, serious head injury, bipolar (manic-depressive) illness,
or anorexia or bulimia (eating disorders). </p>
<p>Some doctors may recommend combination therapy for
heavily-addicted
smokers, such as using bupropion along with a nicotine patch and/or a
short-acting form of NRT (such as gum or lozenges). The combination has
been found to work better in some people than using any one part alone.
</p>
<p class="t8">Varenicline (Chantix&trade;)
</p>
<p>Varenicline (Chantix&trade;) is a newer prescription
medicine
developed to help people stop smoking. It works by interfering with
nicotine receptors in the brain. This means it has 2 effects: it
lessens the pleasurable physical effects a person gets from smoking,
and it reduces the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. </p>
<p>Several studies have shown varenicline can more than double
the
chances of quitting smoking. Some studies have also found it may work
better than bupropion, at least in the short term. </p>
<p>Varenicline comes in pill form and is taken after meals, with
a full
glass of water. The daily dose increases over the first 8 days it is
taken. The dose starts at one 0.5 mg pill a day for the first 3 days,
then the 0.5 mg pill twice a day for the next 4 days. At the start of
the second week, the dose is raised to 1 mg each morning and evening.
For people who have problems with the higher dose, a lower dose may be
used during the quit effort. Varenicline is given for 12 weeks, but
people who quit during that time may get another 12 weeks of treatment
to boost their chance of staying quit. </p>
<p>Reported side effects of varenicline have included headaches,
nausea, vomiting, trouble sleeping, unusual dreams, flatulence (gas),
and changes in taste. There have also been more recent reports of
depressed mood, thoughts of suicide, attempted suicide, and changes in
behavior in people taking varenicline. People who have these problems
should contact their doctors right away. These side effects may happen,
but varenicline is usually well-tolerated. </p>
<p>Since varenicline is a newer drug, not much research has been
done
yet to find out if it is safe to use at the same time as nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) products. A recent study has suggested that
using varenicline along with NRT is well-tolerated and safe. But the
company that makes varenicline noted that people who used the drug
along with NRT had more side effects such as nausea and headaches. More
research is needed. </p>
<p class="t8">Other drugs that are not FDA-approved for
helping smokers quit
</p>
<p>For those who cannot use any of the FDA-approved drugs for
helping
smokers quit, or for those who have not been able to quit using them,
there are other drugs that have shown promise in research studies. They
are recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for
this kind of use, but have not been approved by the FDA for this
purpose and are used "off-label." (See our document <a
 href="/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_2x_Off-Label_Drug_Use.asp"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Off Label Drug Use</span></a>
for more information.) These drugs are only available with a
prescription and are not recommended for pregnant smokers, teens, or
people who smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day. </p>
<p class="t11">Nortriptyline
</p>
<p>This is an older anti-depressant drug. When used in groups of
smokers, it has been found to double their chances of success in
quitting smoking. It is started 10 to 28 days before you stop smoking
to allow it to reach a stable level in the body. </p>
<p>Some people have side effects like fast heart rate, blurred
vision,
trouble urinating, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain or loss, and
low blood pressure when they stand up. The drug can impair your ability
to drive or operate machinery, and there are certain drugs that cannot
be used along with it. </p>
<p>Be sure your doctor and pharmacist know exactly what you are
taking
before you start this medicine. Also be sure you know how to take it
and how to taper it down when you are ready to stop. The dose of
nortriptyline must be slowly lowered, since the drug cannot be stopped
suddenly without the possibility of serious effects. The drug must be
used with caution in people with heart disease. </p>
<p class="t11">Clonidine
</p>
<p>Clonidine is also an older drug that is FDA approved for the
treatment of high blood pressure. When used for smoking cessation, it
can be given as a pill twice a day or as a once-a-week skin patch. In
one study of heavy smokers who had failed in previous quit attempts,
the group treated with clonidine was twice as likely to succeed in
quitting smoking as the control group (which was given a fake pill) at
the end of 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Be sure your doctor and pharmacist know exactly what you are
taking
before you start this medicine. The most common side effects of
clonidine are constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and
unusual tiredness or weakness. There are rarely more severe side
effects, such as allergic reactions, slow heart rate, and very high or
very low blood pressure. Your doctor may want to watch your blood
pressure while you are on this drug. The drug can impair your ability
to drive or operate machinery
</p>
<p>Clonidine can be started up to 3 days before you quit smoking,
but
can also be started the day you quit. Like nortriptyline, it shouldn't
be stopped suddenly. The dose must be lowered over 2 to 4 days to
prevent a rapid increase in blood pressure, agitation, confusion, or
tremors.
</p>
<p class="t7">Other methods of quitting
</p>
<p>Other tools may also help some people, but there is no strong
proof that they can improve your chances of quitting.
</p>
<p class="t11">Hypnosis
</p>
<p>Hypnosis methods vary a great deal, which makes it hard to
study as
a way to stop smoking. For the most part, reviews that looked at
studies of hypnosis to help people quit smoking have not supported it
as a quitting method that works. Still, some people find it useful. If
you would like to try it, ask your doctor if he or she can recommend a
good hypnotherapist. </p>
<p class="t11">Acupuncture
</p>
<p>This method has been used to quit smoking, but there is little
evidence to show that it works. Acupuncture for smoking is usually done
on certain parts of the ears. (See our document, <a
 href="/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Acupuncture.asp"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Acupuncture</span></a>
for more information.) For a list of local physician acupuncturists,
contact the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture at 323-937-5514 or
visit their Web site at <a
 href="/docroot/ipg.asp?sitename=American%20Academy%20of%20Medical%20Acupuncture&amp;url=http://www.medicalacupuncture.org">www.medicalacupuncture.org</a>.
</p>
<p class="t11">Low-level laser therapy
</p>
<p>This technique, also called cold laser therapy, is related to
acupuncture. Cold lasers are sometimes used for acupuncture. The laser
beams are used instead of needles to stimulate the body's acupoints.
The treatment is supposed to relax the smoker and release endorphins
(pain relief substances that are made naturally by the body) to mimic
the effects of nicotine in the brain, or balance the body's energy to
relieve the addiction. Despite claims of success by some cold laser
therapy providers, there is no scientific evidence that shows this
helps people stop smoking. (See our document, <a
 href="/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Cold_Laser_Therapy.asp"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Cold Laser Therapy</span></a>
for more information.)
</p>
<p class="t11">Filters
</p>
<p>Filters that reduce tar and nicotine in cigarettes do not
work. In
fact, studies have shown that smokers who use filters tend to smoke
more.
</p>
<p class="t11">Smoking deterrents
</p>
<p>Other methods have been used to help stop smoking, such as
over-the-counter products that change the taste of tobacco,
stop-smoking diets that curb nicotine cravings, and combinations of
vitamins. At this time there is little scientific evidence to support
that any of these work.
</p>
<p class="t11">Herbs and supplements
</p>
<p>There is little scientific evidence to support the use of
homeopathic aids and herbal supplements as stop-smoking methods.
Because they are marketed as dietary supplements (not drugs), they
don't need FDA approval to be sold. The manufacturers don't have to
prove they work, or even that they're safe. Be sure to look closely at
the label of any product that claims it can help you stop smoking. No
dietary supplement has been proven to help people quit smoking. Most of
these supplements are combinations of herbs, but not nicotine. They
have no proven track record of helping people to stop smoking.
</p>
<p class="t11">Atropine and scopolamine combination
therapy
</p>
<p>A few smoking cessation clinics offer a program using shots of
the
drugs atropine and scopolamine, sometimes along with other drugs, to
help reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These drugs block the action
of acetylcholine, a signal transmitter in the nervous system. Called
anticholinergics, they are more often prescribed for other reasons,
such as digestive problems, motion sickness, or Parkinson's disease.
People who are pregnant or have heart problems, glaucoma, or
uncontrolled high blood pressure are not allowed to take part in these
programs. </p>
<p>The treatment usually involves shots given in the clinic on
one day,
then a few weeks of pills and wearing patches behind the ear. Other
drugs may be needed to help with side effects. Side effects of this
treatment can include dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, changes in
the sense of taste and smell, problems urinating, and blurry vision. </p>
<p>Some clinics claim high success rates, but the available
published
scientific research does not back up these claims. Both atropine and
scopolamine are FDA-approved for other uses and have not been formally
studied or approved for help in quitting smoking. Before going into
such a program, you may want to ask the clinic about long-term success
rates (up to a year). These medicines are directed only at the physical
aspect of quitting, so you may also want to find out if the program
includes counseling or other methods aimed at the psychological aspects
of quitting.
</p>
<p class="t8"><a
 name="Other_nicotine_and_tobacco_products_not"></a>Other
nicotine and tobacco products not reviewed or approved by the FDA
</p>
<p class="t11">Tobacco lozenges and pouches
</p>
<p>Lozenges that contain tobacco (like Ariva<sup>&reg;</sup>
and Interval<sup>&reg;</sup>), and small, pouches of
tobacco (like Revel<sup>&reg;</sup> and Exalt<sup>&reg;</sup>)
are being sold as other ways for smokers to get nicotine in places
where smoking is not allowed. The FDA has ruled that these are types of
oral tobacco products much like snuff and chew, and are not smoking
cessation aids. There is no evidence that these products can help a
person quit smoking. Unlike scientifically proven treatments with known
effects, such as nicotine replacement products, anti-depressants,
nicotine receptor blockers, or behavioral therapy, these oral tobacco
products have never been tested to see if they can help people quit
tobacco. </p>
<p>We know that oral tobacco products such as snuff and chewing
tobacco
contain human carcinogens. These products cause mouth cancer and gum
disease. They also destroy the bone sockets around teeth and can cause
teeth to fall out. There are studies showing potential harmful effects
on the heart and circulation, as well as increased risks of other
cancers. They also cause bad breath and stain the teeth. </p>
<p class="t11">Electronic cigarettes
</p>
<p>In 2004, a Chinese company started making a refillable
"cigarette"
with a battery and an electronic chip in it. It is designed to look
like a cigarette, right down to the glowing tip. When the smoker puffs
on it, the system delivers a mist of liquid, flavorings, and nicotine
that looks something like smoke. The smoker inhales it like cigarette
smoke, and the nicotine is absorbed into the lungs.
</p>
<p>The electronic cigarette, or e-cigarette, is sold with
cartridges of
nicotine and flavorings. Several brands and varieties of the
e-cigarette are now sold in the U.S. Here, the e-cigarette is usually
sold as a way to get nicotine in places where smoking is not allowed,
although some may sell it as a way to quit smoking. The cartridges are
sold as having different doses of nicotine, from high doses to no
nicotine at all.
</p>
<p>The e-cigarette has no published clinical trials that suggest
it
might work as a way to help smokers quit. No clinical trials have been
submitted to the FDA. As of 2009, the FDA has not ruled as to whether
e-cigarettes are medical devices but it is investigating. There are
also questions about how safe it is to inhale some substances in the
nicotine mists into the lungs. E-cigarettes are not labeled with their
ingredients, so the consumer doesn't know what's in them. And even
substances that are safe to eat can harm delicate tissues inside the
lungs.
</p>
<p>Newer information from the FDA suggests that e-cigarettes are
not
safe. A 2009 analysis of 18 samples of cartridges from 2 leading
e-cigarette brands found cancer-causing substances in half the samples.
There were other impurities noted as well. For example, diethylene
glycol, a toxic ingredient found in antifreeze, was found in one
sample. </p>
<p>Information from the same testing suggests that there may be
manufacturing problems with e-cigarettes. Nicotine levels from each
puff varied a great deal, even between cartridges labeled as having the
same nicotine amounts. Testing also found small amounts of nicotine in
most of the cartridges labeled nicotine-free.
</p>
<p>Like other forms of nicotine, the e-cigarettes and nicotine
cartridges can be toxic to children or pets. They can also pose a
choking hazard.
</p>
<p class="t11">Nicotine lollipops and lip balms
</p>
<p>In the past, some pharmacies made a product called a nicotine
lollipop. These lollipops often contained a product called nicotine
salicylate with a sugar sweetener. Nicotine salicylate is not approved
by the FDA for pharmacy use. The FDA has warned pharmacies to stop
selling nicotine lollipops and lip balm on the Internet, calling the
products "illegal." The FDA also said "the candy-like products present
a risk of accidental use by children."
</p>
<p>Other smoking cessation products like these may not use
nicotine
salicylate and, therefore, may be legal. But they still pose a risk for
children if they are not well-labeled and stored safely.
</p>
<p class="t11">Nicotine water and nicotine wafers
</p>
<p>These products are advertised as ways to get nicotine in
places
where smoking is not allowed. They are not marketed as aids to quitting
smoking, but questions about their safety have been raised. Some of
these formulas can be quite dangerous if accidentally taken by children
or pets, so they must be stored carefully.
</p>
<p class="t7">A word about quitting success rates
</p>
<p>Before you start using nicotine replacement or sign up for a
stop
smoking class or program, you may wonder about its success rate.
Success rates are hard to figure out for many reasons. First, not all
programs define success in the same way. Does success mean that a
person is not smoking at the end of the program? After 3 months? 6
months? 1 year? Does smoking fewer cigarettes (rather than stopping
completely) count as success? If a program you're considering claims a
certain success rate, ask for more details on how success is defined
and what kind of follow-up is done to confirm the rate.
</p>
<p>The truth is that quit smoking programs, like other programs
that
treat addictions, often have fairly low success rates. But that does
not mean they are not worthwhile or that you should be discouraged.
Your own success in quitting is what really counts, and that is under
your control.
</p>
<p class="t11">Success rates in general
</p>
<p>Only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any
given attempt without medicines or other help.
</p>
<p>Studies in medical journals have reported that between about
25% and
33% of smokers who use medicines can stay smoke-free for over 6 months.
There is also early evidence that combining some medicines may work
better than using them alone. (See the section, "<a
 href="#Help_with_the_physical_part_of_addiction">Help with
the physical
part of addiction</a>.")
</p>
<p>Behavioral and supportive therapies may increase success rates
even
further. Check the package insert of any product you are using to see
if the manufacturer provides free telephone-based counseling.
</p>
<p class="t7"><a name="How_to_quit"></a>How
to quit
</p>
<p>Smokers often say, "Don't tell me why to quit, tell me how."
There
is no one right way to quit, but there are some key elements in
quitting with success. These 4 factors are key:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>making the decision to quit </li>
  <li>setting a quit date and choosing a quit plan </li>
  <li>dealing with withdrawal </li>
  <li>staying quit (maintenance) </li>
</ul>
<p class="t8">Making the decision to quit
</p>
<p>The decision to quit smoking is one that only you can make.
Others
may want you to quit, but the real commitment must come from you.
</p>
<p>Think about why you want to quit.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you worried that you could get a smoking-related
disease? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do you really believe that the benefits of quitting
outweigh the benefits of continuing to smoke? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do you know someone who has had health problems because of
their smoking? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Are you ready to make a serious try at quitting? </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are thinking about quitting, setting a date and
deciding on a plan will move you to the next step.
</p>
<p class="t8">Setting a quit date and making a plan
</p>
<p class="t11">Pick a Quit Day
</p>
<p>Once you've decided to quit, you're ready to pick a quit date.
This
is a very important step. Pick a specific day within the next month as
your Quit Day. Picking a date too far away can allow you time to
rationalize and change your mind. But do give yourself enough time to
prepare and come up with a plan. You might choose a date with a special
meaning like a birthday or anniversary, or the date of the Great
American Smokeout (the third Thursday in November each year). Or you
may want to just pick a random date. Circle the date on your calendar.
Make a strong, personal commitment to quit on that day.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan for your
prescriptions: </span>Remember
that if you are planning to use a prescription drug, you will need to
talk with your doctor about getting it in time for your Quit Day. If
you plan to use bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Chantix), you must
start taking the drug a full week before your Quit Day. If you are
using one of these medicines, add a note on your calendar for the week
before your Quit Day to remind you to start taking the drug.
</p>
<p class="t11">Prepare for your Quit Day
</p>
<p>There is no one right way to quit. Most smokers prefer to quit
cold
turkey -- they stop completely, all at once. They smoke until their
Quit Day and then quit. Or they may smoke fewer cigarettes for 1 or 2
weeks before their Quit Day. Another way involves cutting down on the
number of cigarettes you smoke each day. With this method, you slowly
reduce the amount of nicotine in your body. You might cut out
cigarettes smoked with a cup of coffee, or you might decide to smoke
only at certain times of the day. While it makes sense to cut down in
order to reduce withdrawal symptoms, in practice this can be hard to
do. </p>
<p>Quitting smoking is a lot like losing weight: it takes a
strong
commitment over a long time. Smokers may wish there was a magic bullet
-- a pill or method that would make quitting painless and easy. But
there is nothing like that. Nicotine substitutes can help reduce
withdrawal symptoms, but they work best when they are used as part of a
stop-smoking plan that addresses both the physical and psychological
components of quitting smoking. </p>
<p>Here are some steps to help you prepare for your Quit Day:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pick the date and mark it on your calendar. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Tell friends and family about your Quit Day. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Get rid of all the cigarettes and ashtrays in your home,
car, and place of work. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Stock up on oral substitutes -- sugarless gum, carrot
sticks,
hard candy, cinnamon sticks, coffee stirrers, straws, and/or
toothpicks.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Decide on a plan. Will you use NRT or other medicines? Will
you attend a stop-smoking class? If so, sign up now. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Practice saying, "No thank you, I don't smoke." </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a support system. This could be a group class,
Nicotine
Anonymous, or a friend or family member who has successfully quit and
is willing to help you. Ask family and friends who still smoke not to
smoke around you or leave cigarettes out where you can see them.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If you are using bupropion or varenicline, take your dose
each day of the week leading up to your Quit Day. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Think back to your past attempts to quit. Try to figure out
what worked and what did not work for you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Successful quitting is a matter of planning and commitment,
not
luck. Decide now on your own plan. Some options include using nicotine
replacement or other medicines, joining a stop-smoking class, going to
Nicotine Anonymous meetings, using self-help materials such as books
and pamphlets, or some combination of these methods. For the best
chance at success, your plan should include 2 or more of these options.
</p>
<p class="t11">Your Quit Day
</p>
<p>On your Quit Day, follow these suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not smoke. This means <span
 style="font-style: italic;">none at all</span> -- not
even one puff! </li>
  <li>Keep active -- try walking, exercising, or doing other
activities or hobbies. </li>
  <li>Drink lots of water and juices. </li>
  <li>Begin using nicotine replacement if that is your choice. </li>
  <li>Attend stop-smoking class or follow your self-help plan. </li>
  <li>Avoid situations where the urge to smoke is strong. </li>
  <li>Reduce or avoid alcohol. </li>
  <li>Think about changing your routine. Use a different route to
go to
work, drink tea instead of coffee. Eat breakfast in a different place
or eat different foods.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Read on to find out more about the kinds of thoughts and
temptations
that come up when you try to quit, and ideas for ways to deal with or
avoid them.
</p>
<p class="t8">Dealing with withdrawal
</p>
<p>Withdrawal from nicotine has 2 parts -- the physical and the
mental.
The physical symptoms, while annoying, are not life-threatening.
Nicotine replacement and other medicines can help reduce many of these
physical symptoms. Most smokers find that the bigger challenge is the
mental part of quitting.
</p>
<p>If you have been smoking for any length of time, smoking has
become
linked with nearly everything you do -- waking up in the morning,
eating, reading, watching TV, and drinking coffee, for example. It will
take time to "un-link" smoking from these activities. This is why, even
if you are using a nicotine replacement, you may still have strong
urges to smoke. </p>
<p class="t11">Rationalizations are sneaky
</p>
<p>One way to overcome these urges or cravings is to notice and
identify rationalizations as they come up. A rationalization is a
mistaken thought that seems to make sense to you at the time, but the
thought is not based on reality. If you choose to believe in such a
thought, it can serve as a way to justify smoking. If you have tried to
quit before, you will probably recognize many of these common
rationalizations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'll just have one to get through this rough spot. </li>
  <li>Today is not a good day. I'll quit tomorrow. </li>
  <li>It's my only vice. </li>
  <li>How bad is smoking, really? Uncle Harry smoked all his life
and he lived to be over 90. </li>
  <li>Air pollution is probably just as bad. </li>
  <li>You've got to die of something. </li>
  <li>Life is no fun without smoking. </li>
</ul>
<p>You probably can add more to the list. As you go through the
first
few days without smoking, write down any rationalizations as they come
up and recognize them for what they are: messages that can trick you
into going back to smoking. Look out for them, because they always show
up when you're trying to quit. After you write down the idea, let it go
from your mind. Be ready with a distraction, a plan of action, and
other ways to re-direct your thoughts to something else.
</p>
<p>Use the ideas below to help you stay committed to quitting.
</p>
<p class="t11">Avoid temptation
</p>
<p>Stay away from people and places where you are tempted to
smoke. Later on you will be able to handle these with more confidence.
</p>
<p class="t11">Change your habits
</p>
<p>Switch to juices or water instead of alcohol or coffee. Take a
different route to work. Take a brisk walk instead of a coffee break.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Alternatives:</span>
Use substitutes you can put in your mouth such as sugarless gum or hard
candy, raw vegetables such as carrot sticks, or sunflower seeds. Some
people chew on a coffee stirrer or a straw.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Activities:</span>
Do something to reduce your stress. Exercise or do hobbies that keep
your hands busy, such as needlework or woodworking, which can help
distract you from the urge to smoke. Take a hot bath, exercise, or read
a book.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Deep breathing:</span>
When you were smoking, you breathed deeply as you inhaled the smoke.
When the urge strikes now, breathe deeply and picture your lungs
filling with fresh, clean air. Remind yourself of your reasons for
quitting and the benefits you'll gain as an ex-smoker.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Delay: </span>If
you feel that you are about to light up, delay. Tell yourself you must
wait at least 10 minutes. Often this simple trick will allow you to
move beyond the strong urge to smoke. </p>
<p class="t11">Reward yourself
</p>
<p>What you're doing is not easy, so you deserve a reward. Put
the
money you would have spent on tobacco in a jar every day and then buy
yourself a weekly treat. Buy a magazine or book, go out to eat, develop
a new hobby, or take a yoga class. Or save the money for a major
purchase. You can also reward yourself in ways that don't cost money:
visit a park, go to the library, and check local news listings for
museums, community centers, and colleges that have free classes,
exhibits, films, and other things to do. </p>
<p class="t8">Staying quit (maintenance)
</p>
<p>Remember the Mark Twain quote? Maybe you, too, have quit many
times
before. If so, you know that staying quit is the final, longest, and
most important stage of the process. You can use the same methods to
stay quit as you did to help you through withdrawal. Think ahead to
those times when you may be tempted to smoke, and plan on how you will
use other ways to cope with these situations.
</p>
<p>More dangerous, perhaps, are the unexpected strong desires to
smoke
that can sometimes happen months, or even years after you've quit. To
get through these without relapse, try these:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review your reasons for quitting and think of all the
benefits to your health, your finances, and your family. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Remind yourself that there is no such thing as just one
cigarette -- or even one puff. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Ride out the desire to smoke. It will go away, but do not
fool yourself into thinking you can have just one. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid alcohol. Drinking lowers your chance of success. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If you are worried about gaining weight, put some energy
into eating a healthy diet and staying active with exercise. </li>
</ul>
<p class="t11">Recovering from slips </p>
<p>What if you do smoke? The difference between a slip and a
relapse is
within your control. A slip is a one-time mistake that is quickly
corrected -- a relapse is going back to smoking. You can use the slip
as an excuse to go back to smoking, or you can look at what went wrong
and renew your commitment to staying away from smoking for good.
</p>
<p>Even if you do relapse, try not to get too discouraged. Very
few
people are able to quit for good on the first try. In fact, it takes
most people many attempts before quitting for good. What's important is
figuring out what helped you when you tried to quit and what worked
against you. You can then use this information to make a stronger
attempt at quitting the next time.
</p>
<p class="t7">Some special concerns
</p>
<p class="t8">Weight gain
</p>
<p>Many smokers do gain some weight when they quit. But even when
steps
aren't taken to try to prevent this, the gain is usually less than 10
pounds. Women tend to gain slightly more weight than men. There is some
evidence that smokers will gain weight after they quit even if they do
not eat more. There are some studies that suggest that nicotine
replacement therapy or bupropion may help delay weight gain, but they
don't prevent it.
</p>
<p>For some people, a concern about weight gain can lead to a
decision
not to quit. But the weight gain that follows quitting smoking is
usually very small. It is much more dangerous to keep smoking than it
is to gain a small amount of weight.
</p>
<p>You are more likely to be quit smoking successfully if you
deal with
the smoking first, and then later take steps to reduce your weight.
While you are quitting, try to focus on ways to help you stay healthy,
rather than on your weight. Stressing about your weight may make it
harder to quit. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and limit the fat.
Be sure to drink plenty of water, and get enough sleep and regular
physical activity. </p>
<p class="t11">Try walking
</p>
<p>Walking is a great way to be physically active and increase
your chances of staying quit. Walking can help you by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>reducing stress </li>
  <li>burning calories and toning muscles </li>
  <li>giving you something to do instead of thinking about
smoking </li>
</ul>
<p>No special equipment or clothing is needed for walking, other
than a
pair of comfortable shoes. And most people can do it pretty much
anytime. You can use these ideas as starting points and come up with
more of your own: </p>
<ul>
  <li>walk around a shopping mall </li>
  <li>get off the bus one stop before you usually do </li>
  <li>find a buddy to walk with during lunch time at work </li>
  <li>take the stairs instead of the elevator </li>
  <li>walk with a friend, family member, or neighbor after dinner
  </li>
  <li>push your baby in a stroller </li>
  <li>take a dog (yours or a maybe neighbor's) out for a walk </li>
</ul>
<p>Set a goal of 30 minutes of physical activity 5 or more times
a
week. But if you don't already exercise regularly, please check with
your doctor before starting any exercise program.
</p>
<p class="t8">Stress </p>
<p>Smokers often mention stress as one of the reasons for going
back to
smoking. Stress is a part of everyone's lives, smokers and non-smokers
alike. The difference is that smokers have come to use nicotine to help
cope with stress and unpleasant emotions. When quitting, you have to
learn new ways of handling stress. Nicotine replacement can help to
some extent, but for long-term success you will need other strategies,
too. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, physical activity is a good
stress-reducer. It
can also help with the short-term sense of depression that some smokers
have when they quit. There are also stress-management classes and
self-help books. Check your community newspaper, library, or bookstore.
</p>
<p>Spiritual practices such as admitting that you cannot control
your
addiction and believing that a higher power can give you strength have
been used with much success to deal with other addictions. These
practices, along with the fellowship of others on a similar path, are a
key part of 12-step recovery programs. These same principles can be
applied to quitting smoking.
</p>
<p class="t8">Taking care of yourself </p>
<p>It is important for your health care provider to know of any
present
or past tobacco use so he or she can be sure that you will get the
preventive health care you need. It is well known that using tobacco
use puts you at risk for certain health-related illnesses, so part of
your health care should focus on related screening and preventive
measures to help you stay as healthy as possible. For example, you will
want to be certain that you regularly check inside your mouth for any
changes. Have your doctor or dentist look at your mouth, tongue, or
throat if you have any changes or problems. The American Cancer Society
recommends that medical check-ups should include oral cavity (mouth)
exams. This way, tobacco users may be able to find changes such as
leukoplakia (white patches on the mouth tissues) early, and prevent
oral cancer or find it at a stage that is easier to treat.
</p>
<p>You should also be aware of any of the following changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>change in cough </li>
  <li>a new cough </li>
  <li>coughing up blood </li>
  <li>hoarseness </li>
  <li>trouble breathing </li>
  <li>wheezing </li>
  <li>headaches </li>
  <li>chest pain </li>
  <li>loss of appetite </li>
  <li>weight loss </li>
  <li>general tiredness </li>
  <li>frequent lung or bronchial infections </li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these could be signs of lung cancer or a number of
other lung
conditions and should be reported to a doctor. While these can be signs
of a problem, people with lung cancer often do not notice any symptoms
until the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. </p>
<p>Remember that tobacco users have a higher risk for other
cancers as
well, depending on the way they use tobacco. You can learn about the
types of cancer you may be at risk for by reading our document that
discusses the way you use tobacco (see the "<a
 href="#Additional_resources">Additional resources</a>"
section). Other risk factors for these cancers may be more important
than your use of tobacco, but you should know about the extra risks
that might apply to you.
</p>
<p>If you have any health concerns that may be related to your
tobacco
use, please see a health care provider as soon as possible. Taking care
of yourself and getting treatment for small problems will give you the
best chance for successful treatment. The best way, though, to take
care of yourself and decrease your risk for life-threatening health
problems is to quit using tobacco.
</p>
<p class="t7">Where can I go for help?
</p>
<p>It is hard to stop smoking. But if you are a tobacco user you
can
quit! More than 47 million Americans have quit smoking for good. Many
organizations offer information, counseling, and other services to help
you quit, as well as information on where to go for help. Other good
resources to ask for help can include your doctor, dentist, local
hospital, or employer.
