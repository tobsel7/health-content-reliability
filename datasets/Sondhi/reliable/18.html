<tr>
<td align=justify>
<br><br>
	It's December in New England. The nights are long, and the pewter skies of winter dim the distant sun during its brief, eight-hour journey across the daytime sky. Day after day, week after week, the darkness hangs low, and soon - spirits wane and the heart begins to sink.
	<br><br>
	Seasonal affective disorder - or, more simply, wintertime depression - affects almost 10% of people living in the northern portions of the United States and up to 5% of people living in the northern half of Alabama. In South Florida, however, where the length of a December day barely dips below eleven hours, only about one out of a hundred people are troubled by seasonal depression.
	<br><br>
	Of all individuals who suffer from depression, about one-fourth of them have a seasonal pattern to their illness; some people with seasonal affective disorder even find themselves developing manic-like symptoms (feeling high) during the long, bright days of summer. But even for those whose depression comes and goes with no particular pattern, exposure to bright light can have a significant antidepressant effect. If only we could run off to some sun-drenched tropical paradise every time we began to feel depressed!
	<br><br>
	Or, instead of leaving home to find more light, could we possibly find a way to bring the light into our home? In fact, we can, and this is the very basis of something called &quot;phototherapy&quot;, which was developed after some interesting studies showed that spending just an hour or so a day under bright artificial lights can be very helpful to those who have depression.
	<br><br>
	The problem is, most people are unsure exactly how to go about setting up a system for light therapy. Not surprisingly, there are several enterprising companies that will be happy to sell you a specially made &quot;light box&quot; for several hundred dollars; of course, at that price, you'll have no money left over for much of anything else! As it turns out, however, these expensive light boxes are no better than a simple light system that you can put together yourself for less than $40.
	<br><br>
	Here's how it works. Go to a discount store like Wal-Mart or Home Depot and purchase three 100-watt or four 90-watt halogen floodlights (not spotlights), or any other halogen floodlights that all together provide a total of at least 4000 lumens of light. These floodlights cost between about $5 and $10 apiece depending on the size and where you buy them. Also, if you don't already have some type of simple fixture to put the lights in, buy fixtures that you can easily move around and aim, such as a &quot;Clamp Lamp&quot; with an aluminum reflector and cord of its own; these usually cost about $5 each.
	<br><br>
	Choose a place you would like to sit (or recline) while being exposed to the lights. Mount or attach the lights approximately six feet in front of you, four to six feet off the floor, and two to four feet apart. Aim the lights slightly downward and inward so that the light from the lamps comes together at just about where your face will be where you will be sitting or reclining.
	<br><br>
	The idea is to have the light shine towards your eyes, and to have it as bright as possible without it being uncomfortably bright or making it hard to see whatever you're looking at. The light should be like that of a bright day on the beach. While in front of the lights, you may watch T.V., listen to music, work at your desk or computer, or do anything else that allows your eyes to catch most of the light.
	<br><br>
	It is best to start with about 30 minutes of light exposure the first few times, then work up to about an hour a day over a week. Most people find that somewhere between 45 and 120 minutes a day of bright light exposure works best. You don't need to sit in front of the lights everyday, but at least four times a week is usually required for a sustained effect on your mood. You can start by sitting in front of the lights whatever time of day is most convenient for you, but many people find that early morning exposure works best.
	<br><br>
	Also, people who are bothered by insomnia often get some relief from exposing themselves to the lights as early as possible during the day; it is as if the bright light early in the morning forces the brain's internal clock to start the day earlier than it might normally start, so that by the time evening rolls around, the brain is ready for sleep at 10:00 p.m. instead of continuing to run until the wee hours of the morning. On the other hand, if you use the lights too late in the afternoon or evening, this could make it harder to sleep at night.
	<br><br>
	Just a few notes of caution.
	<br>
	* The lights get hot, so be sure that there is nothing flammable near the lights or light fixtures.
	<br>
	* The lights don't draw very much current, but care should be taken not to plug them into an already overloaded circuit.
	<br>
	* The lights do not emit ultraviolet radiation so that there is no danger of burning your skin or eyes; some people do, however, get a headache if the light is too bright or they expose themselves to the light for too long.
	<br>
	* Once in awhile, light therapy works so well that the person's mood may get a little too high or even manic-like; obviously, if this starts to happen, you should turn out the lights and call your doctor!
	<br>
	* Although the lights may help depression or insomnia, they are not a substitute for medication or psychotherapy. You should not, therefore, make any changes in your medication or therapy without first discussing this with your doctor or therapist.
	<br><br>
	A little experimenting with your &quot;light therapy&quot; should help you find what works best for you. I even had one patient set up a small room with lights, sand on the floor, a couple of live plants, and a tape of wave noises: She called it her "Caribbean Room" and had all the benefits of an hour on the beach without the sunburn, crowds, or sand fleas!
	<br><br>
	So, when autumn draws near, fight back against that &quot;certain lant of light.&quot; Turn on your lights, sit back and relax, and think of all the money you're saving by not having to leave town to escape that descending shadow of winter.
