"Lyme disease is clearly a very complex disease. When considering a 
similar 
spirochete disease, syphilis, it has been said, "To know syphilis is to 
know medicine." However, to know Lyme disease is not only to know medicine 
but also neurology, psychiatry, politics, economics, and law. The 
complexity of this disease and all that surrounds it challenges our 
scientific as well as our ethical capabilities."

<p><b>
If you have been diagnosed with a 
tick-borne illness, you may be feeling overwhelmed and frightened.  This 
website has been developed to enable you to find the help you need. 
Likewise, if you have not been diagnosed 
but suspect you may have Lyme, this site offers some 
information about where you can turn. 
Regardless of your situation, it is important to be
your own advocate when it comes to Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment.
</b></p>

<p>Whatever your concerns with regard to Lyme disease, please know that
you are not alone.
 Discussing your questions and concerns with others can be very helpful.
Family and friends can be an excellent source of support, but there is no
substitute to talking with others who are going through the same thing.
Lyme disease support groups and online forums have been designed for this
purpose.  
</p>

 <p>
If you have early Lyme disease and/or your symptoms are mild, you may feel 
alarmed by the information you read about chronic Lyme disease.  The 
information about the seriousness of this illness is not intended to 
scare you, but hopefully you will recognize the need to seek 
antibiotic treatment as soon as possible.  According to guidelines 
published by the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society <a 
href="http://www.ilads.org">(ILADS)</a>, "The 
early use of antibiotics can prevent persistent, recurrent, and refractory 
Lyme disease. The duration of therapy should be guided by clinical 
response, rather than by an arbitrary (i.e., 30 day) treatment course."  
It is also important to be evaluated for co-infections.  It may be 
helpful to review their pdf files, <a 
href="http://www.ilads.org/files/2008/Top_ten_tips_5_10_08.pdf">
Top Ten Tips to Prevent Chronic Lyme Disease <em>(pdf)</em></a> and <a 
href="http://www.ilads.org/lyme_disease/Prevent_chronic_lyme.pdf">Prevent 
Chronic Lyme Disease Brochure <em>(pdf)</em></a>.
</p>

<p>Doctors often disagree on the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme 
disease.  Many 
patients groups, including LymeInfo, encourage people to see a 
doctor referred to as a "LLMD", or "Lyme Literate Medical Doctor".
This term is used amongst patients to describe 
any MD (Medical Doctor) or DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) who is knowledgeable 
about Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment as well as the diagnosis and 
treatment of related disorders.  A LLMD can be in a number of different 
specialties of practice, but he/she most often adheres to the guidelines 
set forth by the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society 
(ILADS).  LLMDs generally have a lot of experience 
treating all stages of the illness, including chronic.  The best ways 
to obtain the names of LLMDs in your area are as follows:
</p>
<div class="text">
(1) Contact your local <a 
href="http://www.lymeinfo.net/support.html">Support Group</a>. 
<br />(2) Post to <a href="./directory.html">Online Forums</a> found 
listed 
in LymeInfo's Directory.
<br />(3) See the <a 
href="http://www.lymediseaseassociation.org/referral/LogIn.php?setcookie=yes">
LDA's Automated Referral System</a>.
<br />(4) See the 
<a href="http://www.ilads.org/officers.html">ILADS Officers</a>.
<br />(5) Still no luck?  Try <a 
href="http://www.roadback.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/community.sub/subgroup_id/3.html">Roadback 
Foundation</a> or <a 
href="http://www.rheumatic.org/">Rheumatic.org</a>.

</div>
<br />
<p />To find a support group in your area, see the list of <a 
href="./support.html">Support 
Groups</a>.  To partake in online discussions 
with Lyme patients, please see the online forums listed in the <a 
href="./directory.html">Disease Info Directory</a> at this 
website.  LymeInfo further recommends keeping informed via our <a 
href="./lymeinfo.html">Email News List</a>.  As is the case with this 
website, all of these resources are 
intended to supplement, not replace, the doctor-patient relationship.

<p>Testing for tick-borne illnesses can be complicated, and disease must 
not be ruled out solely on the basis of a negative test result.  However, 
LymeInfo considers <a href="http://www.igenex.com/">IGeneX, Inc.</a> 
(800.832.3200) and <a href="http://www.mdlab.com/html/home.html">Medical 
Diagnostic Lab</a> (877.269.0090) to be the top two labs in the country 
when it comes to testing for these diseases.
