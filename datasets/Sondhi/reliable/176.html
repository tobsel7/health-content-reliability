    <h2>Flu Vaccine </h2>
    <p>The single best way to protect against the flu is to get  vaccinated each year. 
    There are two types of flu vaccines:</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;flu shot&rdquo; &ndash; an inactivated vaccine (contains killed  virus) that is given with a needle, usually in the arm.&nbsp; The flu shot is approved for use in people  older than 6 months, including healthy people and people with chronic medical  conditions.</p>
    <p>The nasal-spray flu vaccine &ndash; a vaccine made with the live,  weakened flu viruses that <strong>do not cause the flu (sometimes called LAIV  for &ldquo;live attenuated influenza vaccine&rdquo; or FluMist&reg;).&nbsp; LAIV (FluMist&reg;) is approved for use in  healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant.</strong></p>
    <p>Note:&nbsp;   Both types of vaccine are available for the seasonal flu and should be available for the novel H1N1 pandemic flu, which is often called the &quot;swine&quot; flu.</p>
    <h3>When should you get the seasonal flu vaccine?</h3>
    <p>Vaccination against seasonal flu began September 1, and is <a href="../shots/index.htm">now available</a>. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages an earlier-than-usual start to seasonal flu vaccination in 2009, and has stated that the vaccine will offer protection for the entire flu season even if it was given in September. Getting vaccinated at any time throughout the flu season will still be beneficial.</p>
    <p>An annual flu shot is recommended if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are age 50 or older </li>
      <li>Are six months to 18 years old (two doses may be required) </li>
      <li>Work or live in a long-term care facility </li>
      <li>Are a woman who will be pregnant during flu season </li>
      <li>Are a healthcare professional </li>
      <li>Have a chronic health problem such as asthma, heart disease, emphysema,   diabetes, HIV or sickle cell disease </li>
      <li>Live in a household with or provide care to a child less than five years old   or an adult 50 or older </li>
      <li>Live in a household with someone who has a medical condition that puts them   at high risk for severe complications from the flu (such as someone with a   chronic health problem, HIV or cancer) </li>
      <li>Want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with flu or transmitting flu to   others this year </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When should you get the H1N1 flu vaccine?</h3>
    <p>The vaccine against the novel H1N1 flu virus is expected to become available in mid-October. More details about its availability from the U-M Health System and University Health Service will be posted on <a href="../shots/index.htm">shots page</a>.</p>
    <p>The vaccine against the novel H1N1 pandemic flu virus (also called swine flu) is especially recommended for: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pregnant women</strong> because they are at higher risk of complications and can potentially provide protection to infants who cannot be vaccinated</li>
      <li><strong>Household contacts and caregivers for children younger than 6 months of age</strong> because younger infants are at higher risk of influenza-related complications and cannot be vaccinated. Vaccination of those in close contact with infants less than 6 months old might help protect infants by &ldquo;cocooning&rdquo; them from the virus</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare and emergency medical services personnel</strong> because infections among healthcare workers have been reported and this can be a potential source of infection for vulnerable patients. Also, increased absenteeism in this population could reduce healthcare system capacity</li>
      <li><strong>All people from 6 months through 24 years of age </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Children from 6 months through 18 years of age</strong> because we have seen many cases of novel H1N1 influenza in children and they are in close contact with each other in school and day care settings, which increases the likelihood of disease spread, and </li>
      <li><strong>Young adults 19 through 24 years</strong> of age because we have seen many cases of novel H1N1 influenza in these healthy young adults and they often live, work, and study in close proximity, and they are a frequently mobile population</li>
      <li><strong>Persons aged 25 through 64 years</strong> who are at higher risk for novel H1N1 because of chronic health disorders or compromised immune systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: If the vaccine is in short supply at first, some members of the above groups may be prioritized higher than others so they can receive the vaccine first. For example, health care workers who have direct contact with patients, and children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, will have higher priority than other health care workers or older children. But as more vaccine is produced, it will be made available to all of the members of the recommended groups. <br />
    </p>
    <h3> You should not receive a flu shot if you:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Are under  six months old</li>
      <li>Have a fever of 101.5&deg; or more </li>
      <li>Have an allergy to eggs/egg products or had a  reaction to a prior flu vaccine</li>
      <li>Have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome  in the past</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You should not receive LAIV (FluMist&reg;) if you:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Are under 2 years of age, or older than 49 years of age </li>
      <li>Have a fever of&nbsp; 101.5&deg; or more </li>
      <li>Have an allergy to eggs/egg products or had a reaction to a prior flu  vaccine</li>
      <li>Have a long term health problem or chronic medical condition</li>
      <li>Have asthma or reactive airway disease or recurrent wheezing or use an  inhaler or nebulizer</li>
      <li>Have a weakened immune system because of HIV/AIDS or another disease that  affects the immune system, long-term treatment with drugs such as steroids, or  cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs</li>
      <li>Are receiving asprin therapy or asprin-containing therapy</li>
      <li>Are pregnant, breast-feeding or could become pregnant in the next month</li>
      <li>Have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome in the past</li>
      <li>Live with or expect to have close contact (in the next 7 days) with a  person whose immune system is severely compromised and who must be in a protective  environment (for example- bone marrow transplant patients or patients in a  hospital room with reverse air flow)</li>
      <li>Have received any other live vaccination in the past 28 days such as MMR, Varicella/chicken pox,  yellow fever</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* If you are allergic to Benadryl  or Epinephrine, you should only receive the flu  vaccine in a medical office with a licensed provider present who is  capable of ordering emergency treatments. </p>
    <h3>Vaccine  Effectiveness</h3>
    <p>The ability of flu vaccine to  protect a person depends on the age and health status of the person getting the  vaccine, and the similarity or &quot;match&quot; between the virus strains in  the vaccine and those in circulation. Testing has shown that both the flu shot  and the nasal-spray vaccine are effective at preventing the flu. </p>
    <p>For more information about the H1N1 vaccine and its effectiveness, visit the <a href="http://cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention H1N1 vaccination page</a>.<br />
</p>
    <h3>Vaccine Side Effects</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The H1N1 vaccine will be similar to a seasonal flu vaccine in all respects, so this list will likely apply to it. However, extra testing is being done on this vaccine before it is released. Further information on that testing and its results will be posted on this page from the <a href="http://cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Different side  effects can be associated with the flu shot and LAIV. </p>
    <p><strong>The flu shot:</strong>&nbsp; The viruses in  the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from the flu  shot.&nbsp; Some minor side effects that could  occur are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given</li>
      <li>low grade fever</li>
      <li>aches</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If these problems occur, they begin soon after the shot and usually only  last 1-2 days.&nbsp; Almost all people who  receive the flu vaccine have no serious problems from it.&nbsp; However, on rare occasions, flu vaccination  can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><strong>LAIV  (FluMist&reg;):&nbsp; </strong>The viruses in the nasal spray are weakened  and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness.&nbsp; (In clinical studies, transmission of vaccine  viruses to close contacts has occurred only rarely.)</p>
    <p>In children, side effects from LAIV (FluMist&reg;)  can include</p>
    <ul>
      <li>runny nose</li>
      <li>wheezing</li>
      <li>headache</li>
      <li>vomiting</li>
      <li>muscle aches</li>
      <li>fever</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In adults, side effects from LAIV (FluMist&reg;)  can include</p>
    <ul>
      <li>runny nose</li>
      <li>headache</li>
      <li>sore throat</li>
      <li>cough</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>People who have systemic  allergic reactions to eggs or chicken protein (such as trouble breathing)  should not receive flu vaccine.&nbsp; </strong></p>
