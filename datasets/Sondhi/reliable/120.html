      Certification Does Not Protect Consumers</CENTER></H2>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If you, as a consumer, want to purchase a fake or a fraud
        of one kind or another, should your government guarantee your
        right to do so? More than that, is your government obligated
        to prosecute one who, knowing of your propensity for fraud, tricks
        you into buying the genuine in place of buying the fake? Remembering
        that &quot;your government&quot; is all the rest of us, is it
        right for you to take our time and money to underwrite such ridiculous
        exercises as making sure you are cheated when you want to be
        cheated? And must we penalize the man who breaks his promise
        to cheat you?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>These astute questions were raised in 1972 by Dick Beeler,
      editor of <I>Animal Health and Nutrition,</I> who was concerned
      about laws being adopted in California and Oregon to certify
      &quot;organic&quot; foods. Those laws signaled the beginning
      of efforts that culminated in 1990 with passage of the U.S. Organic
      Foods Production Act (OFPA), which ordered the U.S. Department
      of Agriculture (USDA) to set certification standards. Although
      USDA had opposed passage of the act, the Alar scare plus a campaign
      by environmental, consumer, and farm groups persuaded Congress
      to include it in the 1990 Farm Bill [1].</P>

          <TD WIDTH="76%">As directed by the law, the Secretary of Agriculture
            established a National Organic Standards Board to help develop
            a list of substances permissible in organic production and handling
            and to advise the Secretary on other aspects of implementing
            a <A HREF="http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop">National Organic Program</A>.
            In 1992, the Secretary appointed 15 people, 8 of whom were industry
            members. The board held 12 full-board meetings and 5 joint committee
            meetings and received additional input through public hearings
            and written submissions from interested persons. It presented
            its recommendations to the Secretary in 1994 and issued 30 subsequent
            addenda. Regulations were proposed in 1997, modified in 1998,
            and are now in effect. As of October 21, 2002, producers who
            meet USDA standards are permitted to display the seal pictured
            here on their packaging.</TD>

      <P>Total retail sales of the organic industry have reportedly
      risen from $1 billion in 1990 to $7.8 billion in 2000 [3]. &quot;Certified&quot;
      organic cropland production expanded from about 400,000 acres
      in 1992 to 1,350,000 in 1999 [2]. Despite this growth, the organic
      industry represents a very small percentage of total agricultural
      production and sales -- only about 0.3% of U.S. cropland and
      0.2% of U.S. pasture was certified organic in 2001 [3,4].</P>

      <H4>Nebulous Definitions</H4>

      <P>The term &quot;organic foods&quot; refers to the methods used
      to produce the foods rather than to characteristics of the food
      themselves. The most common concept of &quot;organically grown&quot;
      food was articulated in 1972 by Robert Rodale, editor of <I>Organic
      Gardening and Farming </I>magazine, at a public hearing:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Food grown without pesticides; grown without artificial fertilizers;
        grown in soil whose humus content is increased by the additions
        of organic matter, grown in soil whose mineral content is increased
        by the application of natural mineral fertilizers; has not been
        treated with preservatives, hormones, antibiotics, etc. [5]</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>In 1980, a team of scientists appointed by the USDA concluded
      that there was no universally accepted definition of &quot;organic
      farming.&quot; Their report stated:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The organic movement represents a spectrum of practices, attitudes,
        and philosophies. On the one hand are those organic practitioners
        who would not use chemical fertilizers or pesticides under any
        circumstances. These producers hold rigidly to their purist philosophy.
        At the other end of the spectrum, organic farmers espouse a more
        flexible approach. While striving to avoid the use of chemical
        fertilizers and pesticides, these practitioners do not rule them
        out entirely. Instead, when absolutely necessary, some fertilizers
        and also herbicides are very selectively and sparingly used as
        a second line of defense. Nevertheless, these farmers, too, consider
        themselves to be organic farmers [6].</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Passage of the Organic Foods Production Act forced the USDA
      to develop an official definition. On December 16, 1997, the
      USDA Agricultural Marketing Service proposed rules for a National
      Organic Program [7]. The proposal applied to all types of agricultural
      products and all aspects of their production and handling, ranging
      from soil fertility management to the packaging and labeling
      of the final product. The proposal included: (a) national standards
      for production and handling, (b) a National List of approved
      synthetic substances, (c) a certification program, (d) a program
      for accrediting certifiers, (e) labeling requirements, (f) enforcement
      provisions, and (g) rules for importing equivalent products.
      The proposed rule defined organic farming and handling as:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>A system that is designed and managed to produce agricultural
        products by the use of methods and substances that maintain the
        integrity of organic agricultural products until they reach the
        consumer. This is accomplished by using, where possible, cultural,
        biological and mechanical methods, as opposed to using substances,
        to fulfill any specific function within the system so as to:
        maintain long-term soil fertility; increase soil biological activity;
        ensure effective pest management; recycle wastes to return nutrients
        to the land; provide attentive care for farm animals; and handle
        the agricultural products without the use of extraneous synthetic
        additives or processing in accordance with the Act and the regulations
        in this part.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>The weed and pest-control methods to which this refers include
      crop rotation, hand cultivation, mulching, soil enrichment, and
      encouraging beneficial predators and microorganisms. If these
      methods are not sufficient, various listed chemicals can be used.
      (The list does not include cytotoxic chemicals that are carbon-based.)
      The proposal did not call for monitoring specific indicators
      of soil and water quality, but left the selection of monitoring
      activities to the producer in consultation with the certifying
      agent.</P>

      <P>For raising animals, antibiotics would not be permitted as
      growth stimulants but would be permitted to counter infections.
      The rules permit up to 20% of animal feed to be obtained from
      non-organic sources. This was done because some nutrients (such
      as trace minerals) are not always available organically. Irradiation,
      which can reduce or eliminate certain pests, kill disease-causing
      bacteria, and prolong food shelf-life, would be permitted during
      processing. Genetic engineering would also be permissible.</P>

      <P>Health-food-industry trade and consumer publications expressed
      widespread dissatisfaction with the 1997 proposal. The Henry
      A. Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture, for example,
      called it &quot;Fatally flawed.&quot; [8] The <A HREF="http://www.ota.com/">Organic
      Farmers Marketing Association</A> stated:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The definition of organic as written in the proposed national
        organic standards lacks the holistic approach central to organic
        practices. The proposed rules take a reductionist approach to
        organic food production that eliminates key concepts such as
        the health of the agro-ecosystem and biodiversity on the farm.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>The USDA received more than 270,000 comments on the proposed
      rules [9]. One distributors' association official wrote that
      if the rules are implemented, its members would seek to buy its
      agricultural products from foreign sources. Others complained
      that the proposed fees were too high. Other objections included
      permitted use of amino acids as growth promoters, antibiotics
      (when necessary to save the animal's life), synthetic animal
      drugs, food additives, and animal feed from non-organic sources.
      Certification agencies with &quot;higher standards&quot; objected
      that they would be prohibited from stating this on their labels.
      Some poultry farmers objected to provisions enabling intermingling
      of range-free poultry and other poultry. However, the vast majority
      of the objections pertain to the provisions that permitted irradiation,
      genetic engineering, and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer
      [10]. The final regulations,published in December 2002, eliminated
      these three provisions. Canada, which in 1999 became the first
      country to establish a national organic standard, also excludes
      these methods [11]. The</P>

      <H4>Premium Price -- For What?</H4>

      <P>The organic rules are intended to<B> </B>address production
      methods rather than the physical qualities of the products themselves.
      In a news release that accompaied the 1997 rules,Glickman stated:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>What is organic? Generally, it is agriculture produced through
        a natural as opposed to synthetic process. The natural portion
        of the definition is fairly obvious, but process is an equally
        critical distinction. When we certify organic, we are certifying
        not just a product but the farming and handling practices that
        yield it. When you buy a certified organic tomato, for instance,
        you are buying the product of an organic farm. And, consumers
        are willing to fork over a little more for that tomato. They've
        shown that they will pay a premium for organic food. National
        standards are our way of ensuring that consumers get what they
        pay for.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I disagree. Many consumers who &quot;fork
      over a little more&quot; believe that believe that the foods
      themselves are more nutritious, safer, and tastier. But the USDA
      proposal itself </FONT>noted that, &quot;No distinctions should
      be made between organically and non-organically produced products
      in terms of quality, appearance, or safety.&quot; In other words,
      no claim should be made that the foods themselves are better
      -- or even different! Some consumers believe that buying &quot;organic&quot;
      foster agricultural practices that are better for the environment.</P>

      <H4>More Nutritious?</H4>

      <P>Organic foods are certainly not more nutritious [12]. The
      nutrient content of plants is determined primarily by heredity.
      Mineral content may be affected by the mineral content of the
      soil, but this has no significance in the overall diet. If essential
      nutrients are missing from the soil, the plant will not grow.
      If plants grow, that means the essential nutrients are present.
      Experiments conducted for many years have found no difference
      in the nutrient content of organically grown crops and those
      grown under standard agricultural conditions.</P>

      <H4>Safer?</H4>

      <P>Many &quot;organic&quot; proponents suggest that their foods
      are safer because they have lower levels of pesticide residues.
      However, the pesticide levels in our food supply are not high.
      In some situations, pesticides even reduce health risks by preventing
      the growth of harmful organisms, including molds that produce
      toxic substances [12].</P>

      <P>To protect consumers, the FDA sets tolerance levels in foods
      and conducts frequent &quot;market basket&quot; studies wherein
      foods from regions throughout the United States are purchased
      and analyzed. Its 1997 tests found that about 60% of fruits and
      vegetables had no detectable pesticides and only about 1.2% of
      domestic and 1.6% of imported foods had violative levels [13].
      Its annual Total Diet Study has always found that America's dietary
      intakes are well within international and Environmental Protection
      Agency standards.</P>

      <P>Most studies conducted since the early 1970s have found that
      the pesticide levels in foods designated organic were similar
      to those that were not. In 1997, <I>Consumer Reports</I> purchased
      about a thousand pounds of tomatoes, peaches, green bell peppers,
      and apples in five cities and tested them for more than 300 synthetic
      pesticides. Traces were detected in 77% of conventional foods
      and 25% of organically labeled foods, but only one sample of
      each exceeded the federal limit [14].</P>

      <P>Pesticides can locate on the surface of foods as well as beneath
      the surface. The amounts that washing can remove depends on their
      location, the amount and temperature of the rinse water, and
      whether detergent is used. Most people rinse their fruits and
      vegetables with plain water before eating them. In fact, <I>Consumer
      Reports on Health</I> has recommended this [15].<I>Consumer Reports</I>
      stated that it did not do so because the FDA tests unwashed products.
      The amount of pesticide removed by simple rinsing has not been
      scientifically studied but is probably small. <I>Consumer Reports</I>
      missed a golden opportunity to assess this.</P>

      <P>Do pesticides found in conventional foods pose a health threat?
      Does the difference in pesticide content warrant buying &quot;organic&quot;
      foods? <I>Consumer Reports</I> equivocates: &quot;For consumers
      in general, the unsettling truth is that no one really knows
      what a lifetime of consuming the tiny quantities of foods might
      do to a person. The effect, if any, is likely to be small for
      most individuals -- but may be significant for the population
      at large.&quot; But the editors also advise, &quot;No one should
      avoid fruits and vegetables for fear of pesticides; the health
      benefits of these foods overwhelm any possible risk.&quot;</P>

      <P>Manfred Kroger, Ph.D., Quackwatch consultant and Professor
      of Food Science at The Pennsylvania State University, has put
      the matter more bluntly:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Scientific agriculture has provided Americans with the safest
        and most abundant food supply in the world. Agricultural chemicals
        are needed to maintain this supply. The risk from pesticide residue,
        if any, is minuscule, is not worth worrying about, and does not
        warrant paying higher prices.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H4>Tastier?</H4>

      <P>&quot;Organically grown&quot; foods are not inherently tastier
      than conventionally grown foods. Taste is influenced by freshness,
      which may depend on how far the products must be shipped from
      farmer to consumer. What kinds of locally grown fruits and vegetables
      are available varies from community to community. Whether they
      are organically or conventionally produced is unlikely to make
      any difference.</P>

      <P>In the early 1990s, Israeli researchers made 460 assessments
      of 9 different fruits and vegetables and no significant difference
      in quality between &quot;organic&quot; and conventionally grown
      samples [16]. The <I>Consumer Reports</I>' study found no consistent
      differences in appearance, flavor, or texture.</P>

      <P>Organically produced (&quot;range-free) poultry are said to
      be raised in an environment where they are free to roam. To use
      this term, handlers must sign an affidavit saying that the chickens
      are provided with access to the outdoors. A recent taste test
      conducted by <I>Consumer Reports</I> rated two brands of free-range
      chicken as average among nine brands tested. Its March 1998 issue
      stated few chickens choose to roam and that one manager said
      that free-ranging probably detracts from taste because it decreases
      the quality of the bird's food intake [17].</P>

      <H4>Better for the Environment?</H4>

      <P>Many buyers of &quot;organic&quot; foods believe that the
      extra money they pay will ultimately benefit the environment
      by encouraging more farmers to use &quot;organic&quot; methods.
      But doing this cannot have much effect because &quot;organic&quot;
      agriculture is too inefficient to meet the world's food needs.
      Moreover, the dividing line between organic and conventional
      agriculture is not sharp because various practices are not restricted
      to one or the other. For example, &quot;organic&quot; farmers
      tend not to use pesticides, but faced with threatened loss of
      crops, they may change their mind. If certain patterns of pesticide
      use cause more harm than good and there is a way to remedy the
      situation, the people concerned about it can seek regulatory
      solutions. I don't believe that paying extra for food will benefit
      anybody but those who sell it.</P>

      <H4>The Bottom Line</H4>

      <P>The revised rules went into effect on October 21, 2002. The
      latest USDA definition states:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use
        of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water
        to enhance environmental quality for future generations. Organic
        meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that
        are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is
        produced without using most conventional pesticides; petroleum-based
        fertilizers or sewage sludge-based fertilizers; bio-engineering;
        or ionizing radiation. Before a product can be labeled &quot;organic,&quot;
        a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food
        is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary
        to meet USDA organic standards. Companies that handle or process
        organic food before it gets to your local supermarket or restaurant
        must be certified, too [18].</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>From now on, if you want to pay extra for your food, the U.S.
      Government will help you do so. Violators of the rules can be
      fined up to $10,000 per violation. But organic &quot;certification,&quot;
      no matter what the rules, will not protect consumers. Foods certified
      as &quot;organic&quot; will neither be safer nor more nutritious
      than &quot;regular&quot; foods. They will just cost more and
      may lessen public confidence in the safety of &quot;ordinary&quot;
      foods. Instead of legitimizing health nonsense, our government
      should do more to attack its spread.</P>

            <P>In regards to your comment that organic food is not healthier
            or safer for you (comments on &quot;juicing&quot;) I must say,
            that is complete BULLSHIT. If you want to eat food that is coated
            in pesticides, plastic, and vegetable wax, FINE. But don't tell
            people that farmers who don't use pesticides are QUACKS.</P>

            <P>For example, the Web page of the <A HREF="http://www.hartzlerfamilydairy.com/">Hartzler
            Family Dairy</A> -- details the history of a company dedicated
            to pesticide-free food and animal products; I thought you'd like
            to know there are professional businessmen and worldwide organizations
            interested in organic farming techniques, as opposed to just
            a few &quot;QUACKS&quot; who like to overprice their produce.
            If you check out the site you'll see not all people who prefer
            organic food are tree-hugging vegetarian wackos who should be
            dismissed as nutty &quot;quacks.&quot;</P>

            <P>It is people like you, medical professionals (who should know
            better) who group organic food with true quackery (like curing
            cancer with magnets) that really endanger the health of this
            nation. Granted, this IS America, and you have every right to
            eat what you want, and even to say you think organic food is
            overpriced, but don't group organic farmers with &quot;quacks&quot;
            just because they prefer not to use pesticides. Honestly, is
            it so nutty to think we would be better off eating food that
            ISN'T full of chemicals and additives, preservatives and artificial
            colors? I feel sorry for you. You are so blind to the threat
            of toxins in your food that colon cancer will probably sneak
            up on you. You'll tell the doctor, &quot;But I ate a low-fat
            diet; but I drank my Metamucil everyday; but I stayed away from
            red meat,&quot; but it won't matter. You will subject yourself
            to chemotherapy (because, being in the medical profession, THAT's
            the only thing that cures cancer, right?). You'll get sicker
            and sicker from pumping even more toxins in your body, and when
            it finally sinks in that maybe you didn't know everything, it
            will be too late to save you. It's too bad you don't think before
            you eat. You're fueling your body with poison on a daily basis.
