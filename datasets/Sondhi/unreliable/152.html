	        <h2>Signs of Alcoholism (alcoholism symptoms)</h2>
							<h3>Bloodshot eyes, rapid pulse</h3>
				Alcoholics can be easily recognized due to their puffy face and bloodshot eyes. Their voice is hoarse and pulse rate is very rapid. They are prone to be irritable, suspicious and over-emotional. 
Alcoholics are likely to suffer symptoms such as bouts of vomiting, delirium, disturbed sleep and impaired judgment
Alcoholics eventually land up with the disease called cirrhosis of liver where the liver is damaged due to heavy drinking. The bowel movement gets disturbed and other complications like, stomach disorder, weak and flaccid heart and damaged brain cells render the person unfit.

		<a href="#top" style="color:#0000FF; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline; font-size:11px;">
		Alcoholism Symptoms, Causes, Remedy and Diet</a>
						<h3>Occasional drink</h3>
		<p>An occasional alcoholic drink is the starting point for alcoholism. Over a period of time, a person who drinks occasionally gets habituated and regular drinking becomes the norm. Quite a lot of people have to indulge in social drinking due to societal and group pressure, while others find an escape route through drinking to evade responsibilities. They are under the misconception that drinking is a form of stress relief.</p>

		Alcoholism home remedies and natural cures, Questions and answers</a>
				<br>
					<h3>Alcoholism treatment using Grapes</h3>
			<p>The restricted diet of grapes for about a month is a vital home remedy for alcoholism. As this fruit contains a very pure form of alcohol, it acts like a healthy alternative to alcohol. The ideal process is to take three meals a day of fresh grapes every five hours. To make this treatment successful, the alcohol should develop strong will power to stop drinking.</p>
					<h3>Alcoholism treatment using Apples</h3>
			<p>Apples when eaten regularly and liberally help in removing intoxication and reduce craving for wines or any other kind of liquor.</p>
					<h3>Alcoholism treatment using Dates</h3>
			<p>Dates are beneficial in treating alcoholism. Rub together 3-4 dates in half a glass of water and have the alcoholic drink this two times a day for a period of about a month.</p>
					<h3>Alcoholism treatment using Bitter Gourd</h3>
			<p>Juice extracted from bitter gourd leaves is the perfect remedy for alcohol intoxication. It is basically useful for the damaged liver. Mix three teaspoons of the juice with a glass of butter milk and consume every morning for a month.</p>
					<h3>Alcoholism treatment using Celery</h3>
			<p>The juice of raw celery creates a sobering effect on the alcoholic patient. In half a glass of water, an equal quantity of celery juice should be mixed and consumed once everyday for a month. This is a very successful home remedy to cure alcoholism.</p>
		<br />

	  	<h2>Diet for alcoholism recovery</h2>
		<a href="#touserremedies" style="color:#0000FF; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline; font-size:11px;">
		Alcoholism : Home Remedies suggested by users</a>
							<h3>Build up body's nutritional integrity, juice fast</h3>
			<p>To prevent the patient from pining for stimulants like alcohol, it is most important to feed ample amounts of nutrients back in his body. To begin with, the patient should be put on purification juice-fast for at least ten days. As this fast will progress, the patient will steadily experience less craving. This will break his drinking pattern and preferably the patient should start on a diet of several small meals a day rather than three large ones. <br><br>The alcoholic needs to exercise regularly and include outdoor activities in his daily schedule.</p>
					<h3>Optimum diet and fresh fruit juice</h3>
			<p>Even after the successful completion of the juice fast, the patient should continue to have an intake of fresh fruit juices and plenty of water. He should eat a healthy diet of such essential nutrients like wholegrain cereals, seeds and sprouts, fresh fruits, nuts and vegetables. Although at the beginning of the treatment, the patient should be given an appropriate replacement to alleviate the craving if and when it occurs. A glass of fresh fruit juice and eating healthy snacks like candy or Soya beans etc will curb his cravings which might increase the urge for drinking in the stages immediately after the treatment.</p>
					<h3>Avoid refined foods</h3>
			<p>Avoid refined food products such as white flour, white sugar, white rice, macaroni products. This can be substituted with brown rice, brown sugar, leafy vegetables and other whole grain products.</p>
		<br />
		  <a name="suggestion"></a><h2>Other Suggestions and herbal treatments for alcoholism</h2>
							<h3>Firm willingness of alcoholic to stop drinking</h3>
				<p>The alcoholic should be motivated to break the 'alcohol habit' through a strong determination to do so and by being consistent in maintaining his food habits. To try to give up alcoholism at once is almost impossible, so the alcoholic should make a firm decision to make a clean break out of the habit of drinking.</p>
							<h3>Warm-water enema and physical exercises</h3>
				<p>Take a warm-water enema daily to rinse out the bowels during the first ten days of the 'juice fast’. Plenty of rest and outdoor physical activities and exercises are recommended.</p>
							<h3>Avoid smoking</h3>
				<p>Avoid smoking as it increases the craving for alcohol.</p>

			<tr><td colspan="2" align="left" class="txt">It is absolute rubbish to believe that there is any form of remedy for an alcoholic. The only known help which definitely works if you work it, is, Alcoholics Anonymous. The fellowship is in every country of the world. Just look it up in your city phone book and you will find a telephone number to call for help and for information about AA Meetings. It is working for me when no other &#39;remedy&#39; could. It would be so nice to think a bunch of apples, grapes or celery, or other food or drinks could &quot;cure&quot; Alcoholism. Alcoholism is a disease for which there is no treatment in the form of food, pills or drinks. Naltrexone is one form of drug given to alleviate the cravings for alcohol, but it doesn&#39;t work for ever, and the patient must have support and understanding and follow a program to improve their outlook on life to have much of a chance of staying sober. Vitamin B is certainly a great help as is plentiful fresh water. We must also learn to read labels on all food and drinks as even the slightest dose of alcohol in any form, will more likely than not, set off a severe craving for more. Diligence is a must. Love in the fellowship to all who need it. Sober and Loving it....Christine A</td>

Alcoholism is not about &quot;will power&quot; or diet issues. It is a progressive disease and can only be &#39;cured&#39; by total ABSTINENCE. Since alcoholism consists of a craving for alcohol and compulsion to drink in spite of past consequences of drinking, the most SUCCESSFUL way to treat it is with the support of other fellow recovering alcoholics in a structured spiritual (non-religious) program that is life long and life changing. And there are plenty of alcoholics without puffy faces, bloodshot eyes, and raspy voices. </p></td>
