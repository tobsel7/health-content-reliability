        The Results Prove the Healing Power of Water</strong></p>
                                  <p>I have used water to cure people who were suffering from &quot;incurable&quot; diseases. I have cured people who suffered for 10 years, 20 years, even 30 years from painful conditions produced by dehydration.</p>
                                  <p>The Mayo Clinic had pronounced Lloyd Palmer, of Minnesota, as incurable. Since 1965 he had suffered from excruciatingly painful arthritis of his spinal column -- ankylosing spondylitis. His spine twisted and lost movement until, he says, he became a &quot;walking comma.&quot;</p>
                                  <p>He suffered pain for 31 years, until he started to drink water and take salt. He writes: &quot;I continue to be pain-free with my ankylosis spondylitis one year after starting the water/salt regime. My blood pressure is normal as well. I thank God every day for allowing me to finally be pain-free.&quot; Lloyd Palmer's story is so incredible that Paul Harvey reported it on his ABC News program. He also wrote a syndicated column, printed in a few hundred newspapers.</p>
                                  <p>In a recent news broadcast on ABC television, Peter Jennings announced that 110 million Americans suffer from chronic pains. The breakthrough medical information these people need to regain their health is now in your hands. Empower yourself -- increase your knowledge of persistent dehydration and its &quot;calling cards,&quot; now that you have the opportunity. Learn the secrets to a much longer pain-free life.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Attention!</strong> It is easy to understand what water does in your body, but bear in mind there is more to it than just simply drinking water. You must learn to rehydrate your body gradually and carefully. You need to recognize your own particular early indicators of thirst. Not everyone is the same. You must learn what can happen to <em>your own body</em> when it becomes dehydrated. Not every body registers drought in the same way. Depending on where the drought has settled, the initial indicators are different in different people.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Q.</strong> Is there more to the cure program than just water?</p>
                                  <p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, there is much more. In the same way you need a road map to drive through a new country, you need more information to understand, prevent, even reverse complications of dehydration. The detailed information in <em><strong>My Natural Miracle Cure Program</strong></em> is vital for your initiation into the new art of self-healing. My information is exclusive and you will not find it elsewhere.</p>
                                  <p><strong>WARNING!</strong> You must learn how to start drinking water in a way that you do not collect water in your lungs-- particularly if you have been dehydrated for some time, or if you are on medications-- and eventually wish to get off medications.</p>
                                  <p>In <em><strong>My Natural Miracle Cure Program</strong></em> I will show you how to:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cure virtually all pains at no cost</strong> -- <strong>forever</strong> -- without drugs, surgery, acupuncture, herbal prescriptions, manipulation, homeopathy, meditation, bio-feedback, hypnosis, or other commercial ways used for relief of pain.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduce your blood pressure naturally</strong>, without any harmful medication -- such as diuretics that further dehydrate the body. When blood pressure is raised, the body is operating a water-rationing program -- it has to raise the pressure to inject filtered water into vital cells. This is why diuretics are slow poisons that surely and prematurely kill. Wise up to this discovery if you or someone you know is suffering from high blood pressure! I am not selling water. I am sharing this information with you free of charge. But you need to know more.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Lower your blood cholesterol</strong> without medication.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Add many healthy pain-free years</strong> to your life.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Lose unwanted pounds of excess weight</strong>. Look and feel years younger. Donna Gutkowski's letter on page 111 of <strong>Your Body&rsquo;s Many Cries for Water </strong>tells her story of how she lost 40 pounds of unsightly weight before she got married. &quot;I can walk down the aisle looking better than I have looked in 15 years.&quot;<br>
                                        <br>

                                    <li><strong>Regain your youthful skin</strong>. Get rid of &quot;crow's feet&quot; on your face.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Become stress-free</strong>. Don't forget, the stress-relieving and disease-curing miracles of water were first discovered in a harsh political prison.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Prevent and cure migraine headaches</strong>. (Read Mavis Butler's astonishing letter on page 52 of the Cries for Water book, and discover how water changed her life. At times she did not wish to live because of long-lasting headaches that kept her in bed for days on end -- in pain!)<br>

                                    <li><strong>Prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Regain your memory, even in old age. THINK! The brain is 85 percent water. When water in the brain becomes insufficient, the brain shrinks. The plum-like cells become prune-like. Only in their natural fully hydrated state are brain cells able to connect and &quot;talk&quot; to one another, and we are able to remember things. This is why my research indicates that Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is caused by chronic dehydration of the brain cells. When dehydrated, many brain cells die. Unlike other cells in the body, new brain cells are not produced to replace the dying ones. Learn to prevent brain cells&rsquo; early death. Learn to even partially reverse some of the damages of dehydration of your brain.<br>

                                    <li><strong>Prevent heart disease</strong>. Cure angina pain. Read the letters on pages 92 and 93 from Sam Liguori and 90-year-old Loretta Johnson, long-time angina sufferers whose conditions were cured completely.<br>
                                        <br>

                                    <li><strong>Learn to give your body what it needs</strong>. Avoid giving it substances that cause further problems. Most medications are nothing less than slow poisons with dangerous side effects. They do not correct the on-going problem of dehydration.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Cure asthma in a few days - forever</strong>. In chapter 9 of my book, you will read how asthma and allergies occur. You will read testimonials from several asthma sufferers who describe how water and salt saved them from constant shortness of breath, and possible suffocation and death from a more severe attack of asthma. They are just a few of the 14 million asthmatics in this country -- 12 million of them children. Several thousand die every year from suffocation. Dehydration that manifests itself in the form of asthma in still-developing children will undoubtedly produce some genetic damage -- because of altered DNA environment in dehydrated cells. Please join me in my crusade to end asthma in five years. We can do it. All you need to do is to understand how it occurs. You can then advise others who suffer from asthma. The simplicity and effectiveness of the cure is a miracle. You cannot stand on the sidelines of this human suffering! </li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p><strong>Side note on asthma</strong> - to make your blood boil a little more. If you take a look at two feature articles on asthma, one in Life Magazine of May 1997 and the other in Newsweek of May 20, 1997, you will weep for the asthmatic children who are forced to live on constant medication of some sort or another lest they suffocate to death. Naturally, there are quite a number of full page ads for the same recommended drugs in each magazine. Newsweek magazine&rsquo;s science editor has for some time been aware of my discovery that asthma denotes a &quot;state of dehydration,&quot; yet there is no mention of my natural and free asthma cure in the article. I can only assume that advertising dollars are more important to the magazine than the simple cure that is now available for asthmatics!</p>
