                                  <p><strong>Dear Friend:</strong></p>
                                  <p><strong>At Last:</strong> We Can Now Cure Pain and Prevent Disease -- Naturally -- At No Cost:</p>
                                  <p>My ground-breaking medical discovery reveals the missing natural element that prevents -- even cures -- the body&rsquo;s painful degenerative diseases -- naturally and at no cost!</p>
                                  <p>I am honored and proud to inform you that my research over 18 years -- in addition to my medical training and subsequent 33 years as a doctor -- has exposed the simplest natural cure to a vast number of health problems.</p>
                                  <p>I invite you to read this report in its entirety. Read about my discovery, and in the light of the new information, learn how to become your own healer and cure your own health problems naturally -- I repeat, <em>at no cost</em>! Become your own diagnostician and doctor during these health care crisis times -- when you need to take charge of your own health and well-being. Also, you will discover:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Why we in medicine were not able to permanently cure any of the painful degenerative diseases -- until now. And why we have frequently made deadly mistakes that add more pain, suffering, and irreversible complications in the process!<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Why we constantly had to experiment using different chemicals in the futile hope of finding something that would work -- and nothing has worked until now! Look at the spiraling health care costs every year.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Why the drug companies have had to produce so many chemicals that are now proven to make 2,000,000 sicker and have killed over 100,000 annually -- even when used according to their manufacturers&rsquo; recommendations! Judge for yourself how vulnerable we have become! The Washington Post of Wednesday, April 15, 1998 quotes the Journal of the American Medical Association:&quot;One in 15 hospital patients in the United States can expect to suffer from a prescription or over-the-counter medicine, and about 5 percent of these will die as a result!&quot; You should know that 1 in every 4 hospital admissions are said to be due to the side effects of routinely used prescription drugs.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Why all of this is about to change, and with what mind-boggling simplicity! </li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>What you are going to find out may at first sound too good to be true! This newly uncovered &quot;ultimate cure&quot; is so simple you will wonder why it has not been discovered until now! But I will prove every word you are about to read. I will also tell you why I think the drug industry has concealed this information when asking trusting physicians to prescribe its medications.</p>
                                  <p>What you will discover in this letter is that we in medicine are trained to use chemicals to treat pain and disease when all the body needs is water -- a simple and abundantly available natural element. </p>
                                  <p>Yes! Only water!</p>
                                  <p>This is the reason why we in medicine have made so many deadly mistakes! We are routinely treating symptoms, signs and complications of drought in the body with toxic chemicals that kill more rapidly than the dehydration itself!</p>
                                  <p>Who in his/her right mind would want to take toxic chemicals when all that their body needs is water -- free water -- natural water, the ultimate medication of choice to cure pain and prevent disease?</p>
                                  <p>The commercial &quot;sick-care&quot; system and the drug industry do not want you to know that in most health problems you are only thirsty and not sick!</p>
                                  <p>They survive and thrive if we remain ignorant of the knowledge of the different ways our bodies show we are thirsty -- that we are suffering from local or regional drought. When there is shortage of water, some parts of the body are forced to go without water. In this report, you will get to know how the drought-stricken parts reflect dehydration, and how you can recognize that you are truly thirsty. <em>You will recognize why &quot;dry mouth&quot; is not a sign of thirst, but why different pains are</em>!</p>
                                  <p>Understanding dehydration will empower you to become much healthier and live longer. There is more to it than just drinking water. <em>You will need to invest a little bit of your time and concentration and begin to understand the subject</em>. You might think: &quot;I now know I need to drink water; that is enough.&quot; But you knew that all along. What you did not know -- and need to know -- is why and what happens if you too become forgetful and complacent, like millions of others who did not drink water until they got seriously sick -- with this or that disease -- but actually died of dehydration. Also remember, the body is not a container that can be replenished when empty. When dehydration has become symptom-producing, the reversal of its complications take time and understanding. This is the information you need.</p>
                                  <p>The fundamentals of the information you have in your hands have been scientifically peer-reviewed and presented at different national and international medical conferences -- and published in scientific journals. You are receiving this information directly because the <strong>AMA</strong> and <strong>The National Institutes of Health</strong> -- that you fund with your tax dollars and believe they are working for you -- have so far refused to tell the American people they were wrong in their past assumptions about the cause of pain and disease in the human body.</p>
                                  <p>Now that I am at it, and before we get into the meat of this report, let me first give you some background information, and then tell you a <em>true story</em> that will dispel any illusions you may have had about the drug companies being on your side!</p>
                                  <p>As you will learn, I have the scientific distinction of having successfully treated with only water over 3,000 people suffering from peptic ulcer disease. My report of this event was published as the main editorial of the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology in June 1983, and also reported in the SCIENCE WATCH (Science Times) of the New York Times, Tuesday, June 21, 1983.</p>
                                  <p>To me as a clinician, it became obvious that these people were suffering from a &quot;thirst problem&quot; and the label of &quot;disease&quot; is something we have concocted because we have not understood that pain and local damage can be one of the ways that persistent drought in the body shows itself.</p>
                                  <p>One day, at a meeting held in the office of Professor Howard Spiro of Yale University, I made this view known. Professor Gregory Eastwood, who was then head of the department of gastroenterology at the University of Massachusetts, and who is now dean of a prestigious medical school, asked me if I could prove this view scientifically. I said I could.</p>
