There's a <strong>revolutionary procedure to correct vision defects and improve your eyesight</strong>, many doctors don't know about. But, the truth is, those professionals familiar with the technique feel disclosing vision enhancing practices to clients goes against their ‘financial' judgment.<br>
<br>
 
Instead, what happens is doctors continue to prescribe glasses and contacts that do nothing but ensure over time, <strong>your eye muscles get weaker</strong> and you continue to be dependent on purchasing corrective wear for the rest of your life. <br>
<br>

But, what ophthalmologists fail to tell you is your vision gets worse each time you slide your lens handle over your ear.<br><br><br>

You may be thinking, &#147;I'll just look into corrective eye surgery so I don't have to worry about my vision being affected by glasses or contacts.&#148; Sorry, to say, but surgery won't fix your vision problems either. <br><br>

If you're thinking about getting lasik eye surgery, then you know on top of the thousands of your money you'll invest in the procedure, there's still uncertainty about the <strong>long-term effects</strong>. <br>
<br>

What you might not know is on top of huge investment you'll pay, you'll also be bothered with <strong>inconvenient doctor visits for months after the treatment</strong>. Not to mention the media's exploitations of lasik surgery that should down-right frighten you.<br>
<br>

The media states, there's been <strong>hundreds of reports</strong> from lasik patients who have experienced <strong>lethal eye complications</strong> such as...<br>

<br /><div align="center" class="subheader">&#147;If Glasses and Contacts Harms Vision and Surgery Is Too Risky, Then How Can I<br>Improve My Eyesight?&#148;</div><br />



How can you improve your eyesight? Well what I'm about to say, might shock you.<br /><br />


<center><span style="background:#FFFF00; font-weight:bold">You already have the ability to get perfect vision – naturally.</span><br /><br /></center>

Think about this...<br /><br />

When you were born, doctors didn't check your eyesight as they pulled you from your mother's womb. And, guess what? Eventually, you learned to crawl and walk, without the use of glasses. Didn't you? <br /><br />

Here's another example to consider.<br /><br />

If you've been to remote locations such as the Amazon or have seen T.V. shows that film the way natives live in the wild. You may have seen them how they hunt for food, build tools and make crafts. <strong>But, you'll never see these naturalists squint their eyes, or struggle to focus on their prey. </strong><br />
<br />

And, yet another example of vision regularity comes from recent developments regarding our ancestors. Archaeologists have discovered our ancient decedents had near 20-20 vision. Therefore, they had no need for corrective eyewear. <br /><br />

So, if you didn't need glasses during birth; neither do those living in the wild; nor did your ancestors, then why are many people today so dependent on wearing glasses? <br /><br>


<div align="center" class="subheader">&#147;Exposing The Cause of Vision Problems&#148;</div><br />


<strong>Vision problems are a learned trait. Not a developed trait. </strong><br />
<br />

If you've ever noticed, before a child hits their school years, most of them have perfect vision. <br /><br />

What happens is, children start talking to each other about far-sighted and near-sightedness. Eventually, human nature takes over and the child soon develops poor vision. <br /><br />

It's not a coincidence that once school ends, almost every kid in the senior graduating class wears glasses.<br /><br /> 

And, I'm living testament what I'm saying is true. At age 10, I started experiencing vision problems too. It's just a coincidence that my far-sightedness was discovered right after talking amongst my peers about different vision problems. <br /><br />

Luckily, there is a way to reverse training vision problems. And, to give you a hint, the method doesn't involve wearing burdensome glasses, contacts or undergoing risky eye surgery. <br /><br>


<div align="center" class="subheader">&#147;Helping You Improve Eye Sight – Naturally!&#148;</div>
<p><br />
  For the first 20 years of my career, I owned an ophthalmology practice. In fact, in my city, I've won many awards for having the most prestigious optical business in town. <br>
  <br>
  After learning of my accomplishments as a leading optical doctor, people were shocked when I left my practice to help vision sufferers improve their eyesight – naturally.<br>
  </p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blacktext">
  <tr>
    <td width="89%" valign="top">Luckily, for me, my career path took a turn over 5 years ago. After studying an amazing vision therapy originally created in 1880 by Dr. William H. Bates, a New York ophthalmologist who thought, if broken bones could be healed, why couldn't damaged eyesight? <br />
      <br />
Dr. Bates' argued the use of glasses hindered a patient's eyesight. He later stated, by performing a set of formulated eye relaxation exercises vision defects and poor sight can be cured. </td>
    <td width="11%" align="center"><img src="images/bates.jpg" alt="Dr. William H. Bates" /><br><font size=1><b style="font-weight:bold">Dr. William H. Bates</b></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
His stance against the traditional optical community caused Dr. Bates to leave his practice in 1891. From there, he confirmed his findings by showing eye sufferers how to see without the use of corrective eyewear.<br>
  <br>
  You can say, I've followed the footsteps of Dr. Bates with my own career path. But, not only did the Doctor influence my decision to start my own corrective eye institute, I also spent 5 years perfecting his study. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Now, I've created a system that'll show you, how to get your vision back, naturally.</strong> <br>
  <br>
  You see, since working with Dr. Bates' system, I've helped hundreds of people get rid of their glasses, for good. I've even helped 80 years olds and older develop 20-20 vision. And, I can do the same for you. <br>
  <br>
  What's important is, it doesn't matter if you've been wearing glasses since preschool. If you are not totally blind, Dr. Bates method can work for you. <br> <br>
 
In fact, the Bates method applies to all visual problems, including: <br><br>

In <b>Vision Without Glasses™</b> you'll be taken by the hand, just as I guide my patients, as <strong>I walk you through a series of fun, eye relaxation techniques.</strong>  <br>
<br>

Besides simply learning how to use the Bates method, you'll also see that I've developed his original sight improving concept into an innovative method that's far more advanced in helping you see sharper, clearer, in only a few, short weeks. <br><br>

In the beginning of this letter, I asked you if you wanted the freedom to perform simple, daily activities without being dependent on corrective eye care and you answered, Yes!<br /><br />

Well, you'll be happy to know, your chance is here. And, there's no reason why you should go another day without looking through your eyes with <b>the perfect sight you were born with.</b><br /><br />

All that's asked of you is a willingness to perform a couple of simple relaxation exercises each day. If you're serious about improving your vision and want to know exactly how then let me ask you one, last question. <br /><br />

How much would you pay to <b>transform poor vision or completely eliminate vision defects into sharp, clear, focused eyesight? </b><br /><br />

Well, if you've done your research you know, eye surgery claims don't even come close to what <b>Vision Without Glasses™</b> can do to improve your eyesight and most lasik eye doctors charge nearly $2,500 per eye. <br />

<b><center style="color:#FF0000;">That's $5000 for Both Eyes!!!!</center></b><br />

And, what's to say that after the costly surgery you won't develop serious complications?<br /><br />

The other option is to keep paying for multiple glasses and cases of contacts each year (depending on how often your vision changes). Glasses and contacts can easily cost up to $500 a year and that's only for one pair. <br /><br />

But, you should know, <b style="background:#FFFF00">the reason I quit the optical field is not to find new ways to charge my patients a fortune for something that can be fixed for free. That's why I've kept <b>Vision Without Glasses™</b> at the low price of only $37.00!</b><br /><br />

The only reason why I'm charging you anything is to help cover my 5 year investment of research, study, and testing of <b>Vision Without Glasses™. </b><br /><br />

What's even better is you won't have to waste your valuable time setting up an appointment with me. You can immediately get my expert guidance delivered straight to your computer, at the click of a button. <br /><br />

The only other thing you should know is I'm only giving away my system at the special price to the next 100 clients only. <br /><br />


<b>Currently, there are only <font color=red>14 Copies Left at the discounted price! </font></b><br />
<br />


The reason for giving out a limited number of copies is this system is only an introductory item to a teaching program that'll be released in a few years from now. <br /><br />

<div align="center" class="subheader">&#147;But, you don't want to wait because the next 100 people to order will also get these 5 FREE BOOKS!!!!&#148;<br />
