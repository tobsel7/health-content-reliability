                                  <p>On page 70 of my book, you will read the testimony of a person with MS who was cured with water. In tape #4 of the audio program -- <em>Water: Rx For A Healthier Pain-Free Life</em> that accompanies the book, you will listen to the letter of another person whose one eye, blinded by MS, regained its sight. Both these and other MS patients recovered after they followed the recommendations in <a href="/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=52" class="mainLink">My Natural Miracle Cure Program (CDs) </a>.</p>
                                  <p>In <a href="/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=52" class="mainLink">My Natural Miracle Cure Program (CDs) </a> you will discover:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Why many drinks actually make you more dehydrated, and increase your urgent need for water. <strong>Why diet sodas can actually make you gain weight!</strong> Learn the basic cause of overeating. Learn why 30 percent of Americans are grossly overweight. Discover the only permanent way of losing weight, without the yo-yo effect of other diet programs. The dangers of artificial sweeteners. Discover why the caffeine and false sweeteners in sodas are more harmful together.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Why blood tests do not show dehydration</strong>. Because, in dehydration, 66 percent of the water loss is from inside of the cells in a drought-stricken area. 26 percent of the water loss is from the fluid environment of the cells in the area, and only 8 percent of the water loss is from inside the blood vessels of the area. The blood vessels close up and don&rsquo;t show they have lost 8 percent of the total loss. This is why blood tests are useless in the diagnosis of symptom-producing drought in the body. You need to understand the other signs and symptoms of dehydration that I have identified during my 18 years of research.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Why your body's thirst is not signaled by a &quot;dry mouth.&quot; In fact, there are many indicators of thirst before you develop a dry mouth. Why diseases occur at a level of dehydration that does not cause a dry mouth.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Why doctors are wrong</strong> in their instructions to cut out salt from your daily diet. Learn why this &quot;forbidden&quot; substance is vital to your body. Learn how salt can be used as pain medication in arthritis; as a cure-producing medicine in asthma and allergy treatment. Even in hypertension, it does more good than harm. Learn how water and salt together can CURE many diseases. Learn how to use salt as an effective sleeping &quot;pill!&quot;<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Why even orange juice is only good for you in small amounts. Too much can cause health complications people are not aware of. </li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>Imagine, at the very end of the 20th Century, my colleagues in medical practice do not yet understand the consequences of persistent dehydration, and yet they take charge of the sick in the &quot;sick-care&quot; system! We have until now relied on the drug industry&rsquo;s research to show us new treatment modalities, and the medical schools have towed the line!</p>
                                  <p>This is why I am fighting the system by talking directly to you, and millions like you, by sending you this medical report! From here on, the ball is in your court. Play it well, and free yourself from the self-serving ways of commercial medicine. It angers me when people -- who only need water to be cured of their health problems -- are talked into long-term use of expensive medications (up to $10-$15 a pill) and unnecessary treatment procedures such as: Acupuncture! Manipulations! Surgery! Fad diets! High doses of vitamins! Psychotherapy! Hypnosis! Massage!</p>
                                  <p>My mission today is to help as many people as humanly possible alleviate their pain and disease. To accomplish this, I have distilled my 18 years of research into the most comprehensive book on water available anywhere. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve just completed a 10-hour audio series that picks up where the book ends. If you or a loved one suffer disease or pain, or are simply fed up with fancy double talk from those within the medical establishment, I urge you to order your own copy of <em>My Natural Miracle Cure Program</em>. Included in the program is:</p>
                                  <p>1- The book, <a href="#" class="mainLink">Your Body's Many Cries for Water</a> -- second edition -- hard cover, exclusive to this program. Since its debut, the book has been printed 21 times. It has been translated into a number of languages. Here is what some eminent professionals are saying about it:</p>
                                  <blockquote>

                                  <p>You must give your body what it needs: not what makes you sicker than before.</p>
                                  <p><a href="#" class="mainLink">My Natural Miracle Cure Program</a> will empower you to respond to your body's different &quot;cries&quot; the right way. You will:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Learn why high cholesterol is linked to dehydration, and is not directly connected to the amount of fat you eat. Learn how to lower cholesterol naturally -- without strict diets or chemical treatments that don't work.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Discover why migraine headaches occur, and how to prevent them. Learn why a certain way you sleep can cause head pain. Learn why pain medications stop being effective -- forcing you to change them and often increase their strength.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Discover the hazards of one of the most-used groups of over-the-counter and prescription medication. Some so-called &quot;safe medications&quot; -- regularly advertised on television -- have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. One of the ingredients of these medications is found heavily deposited in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease -- irreversibly damaging the brain.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Learn why colitis, hiatus hernia, and bulimia indicate the body has been calling for water.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Discover how non-prescription pain-killers can damage your health. Many thousands die every year from over-the-counter pain medication. Say no to the use of these chemicals when your body only needs water. All you need to learn is why, when, and how to use water as a medicine.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Discover how to stop childhood allergies once and for all. Stop treating your child's dehydration with drugs before you cause permanent and irreversible damage. One such permanent damage is diabetes. It can quickly follow other calls of the body for water. If you do not want a diabetic child in your family -- needing to inject insulin every day -- read about the link between dehydration and diabetes -- in both the young and the old.<br>
                                        <br>

                                    <li>Discover why a common discomfort of pregnancy is actually the fetus's way of showing it needs water. Discover how sufficient water intake during pregnancy can positively influence the normal growth of the fetus. Remember, the woman's uterus is a physiological school for the fetus. What the fetus learns from the mother's chemistry will program its subsequent life.<br>
                                        <br>

                                    <li>Discover why water is the best weight-reducing substance. I know a man who weighed 480 pounds. He lost 290 pounds in one year by drinking water whenever he felt hungry. He had to have two operations to remove the loose skin. Another man lost 156 pounds in a year and a half. He reduced 14 pant sizes. A 15- to 45-pound weight loss with water is possible with minimal effort.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Discover why water is the best natural diuretic -- and antihistamine. It's also the choice treatment for arthritis, heartburn/hiatus hernia, asthma, allergy, depression, stress, angina pain, hypertension, back pain, heart disease, skin problems, prevention of cancer. And many more.<br>
