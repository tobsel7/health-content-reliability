<h1>Customer Testimonials</h1>
<p>Hello Kevin, how are you? Just letting you know that I have finished reading "Natural Cures” and have begun reading the "More Natural Cures" book.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard it a million times already, but your book is the most life altering and eye opening book EVER!!! I am an overweight 23 year old woman and I, like many others, have tried 100's of weight loss products with little to no success. After reading your book I have changed so much in my life, for the better. Never have I had this much inspiration to better myself and my surroundings.<br />
  <br />
Unfortunately it costs a lot of money to do everything that I would like to but I will do my best to implement most things within the next few years. I have found and Organic Market just outside of my city and I can't wait to start eating better, I have stopped drinking anything except filtered water. Right now I'm using a Brita filter but in due time I will get the water filtration systems on www.ewater.com. I no longer brush my teeth with Brand Name toothpastes and have stopped using deodorants. I take very short showers in luke warm water so it doesn't create humidity. I will be starting a Colon Cleanse in the next couple weeks, and I have been walking almost everyday for 45min-1hour. Bottom line, I thank you with my life and health for having the guts, and passion to write these books and expose the truth about the world we live in. You are a total inspiration and you are changing so many lives for the better. Thanks again, and keep in touch.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin, I''m 16 years old. I have bought all of your books and I love them. I cured myself of IBS, colitis, gastritis, acid reflux, acne, bad breath, bad body odor, anxiety, depression, and I have lost weight thanks to you. I also have more energy and I feel less stressed. I thank God that I saw you on TV and I want to thank you for saving my life. Please keep it up and I''m praying for you. </p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>First of all I would like to thank you for publishing natural cures. It is incredible and frustrating! For years, ever since I took my first &quot;health&quot; class in junior high I was interested in being healthy. Unfortunately the things taught by our teachers and doctors are misleading. I was going going going on the &quot;healthy path&quot; (running cross country and track, eating low fat foods, etc...) I was also very interested in becoming a dietitian. But during my health occupations class I decided to step back from the health field. The dietitian that I job shadowed was obese and it didn't make sense for someone struggling with health and diet to preach to patients, she obviously didn't know or understand the truth about living a healthy life. </p>
<p>My family came to the U.S. in 98, not surprisingly we all gained weight within our first year. Aside from the new form of transportation, cars, instead of the walking...the food had a twist to it, which I wasn't aware of until some time last year, and especially after reading your book.</p>
<p>It is somewhat overwhelming...there are so many tweaks in the system, and all that I believed was good for me, turned out to be one of the leading factors to my weight gain, etc. </p>
<p>I am grateful to be informed, and aware and open minded! I know that changing the world is not possible in one year or by one person. I also know that my future and my health lies in my arms, and that is why I am so very thankful for people like you, sharing your knowledge...and opening the book up to people who care and want to change for the better. </p>
<p>This month I am moving to a much more positive area, a place where organic produce and sunshine is always around!! I look forward to taking the steps towards long and vital health and always bettering myself. </p>
<p>THANKS AGAIN AND BEST WISHES! KEEP SPREADING THE GOOD!!!</p>

<p>I love your books and how you keep writing even though there are a lot of people against you. Your great! I really like the part about autism, because I watch a nine year old boy who is autistic. I never knew what caused it.I wish that I could be a member but that is kind of hard because i am 16 and only get paid seven dollars an hour. Also I am saving for a car and college. Please keep up the good work so that when I am older and can afford to be a member I can.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>I'm halfway done reading your book, Natural Cures, and I've been writing notes to myself regarding the information I’ve been reading. I'm 54 years old and my doctor had me on Lipitor, but the side effects were killing me. My arms and bones were on fire. To offset the pain, I was taking Aleve. Since reading the book, I stopped taking Lipitor and Aleve and I have been walking for an hour with my dog each day and have been eating smarter and I'm drinking this Tea called Bitter Melon Tea. It's very bitter but has been cleaning me out. In the morning, the first thing I do is drink a glass of water. My Cholesterol was 374. I'll back to you in June when they check me again. I drive a ready mix concrete truck for a living and I read your book while I'm waiting in my truck. Talking to different drivers, I see I’m not alone in the search for positive information.</p>

<p>Kevin, I read your Natural Cures book three years ago and it has changed our family's life!! We are healthy and so happy being able to take care of ourselves without the use of antibiotics and other meds. Keep plugging along! We're spreading the word, too! Thank God for your passion.</p>

<p>Since I read Kevin's book it has changed every aspect of my life. I don't   think the same and I don't eat the same. It has truly been an instrument to get   me and my family on the path to a vibrant, abundantly healthy life. I am totally   off any medications for allergies and headaches, which I never dreamed could   happen. I can't quit talking about this book and I have passed it, along with   the DVD, around to everyone that would have an ear to hear the truth. I owe   Kevin big time because that little $30 book has saved me thousands of dollars in   medical bills, etc. I can't say enough about Kevin. Kevin, we love you and we   look up to you tremendously for the work you are doing.</p>

<p>I have read <em>Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About</em>. I love   this book, and I have been following as much advice from this book as much as I   possibly can, and I have seen an incredible difference. Mostly my asthma is in   control, and I am not taking any medications!! I have lost weight without trying   to. Just by changing my food to all organic (without the chemicals, growth   hormones, hydrogenated oils and dairy products) my family and I are already   seeing great changes in our health in just 4 months. I have always believed that   nutrition plays a big role on your well-being, and Kevin just confirmed it for   me. Thank you so much for writing the book and putting the knowledge out there.   I tell all my friends and family to read the book. Good Luck</p>

<p>When I read Kevin's book, it changed my life forever.<br />
    <br />
  I learned so   much. After I read the book, I went through my kitchen cupboards and discarded   every thing that was bad for me and replaced them with whole and organic foods.   I can't say enough how much better physically I feel. I have even lost a few   ponds. I was already taking Chi Gong when I discovered the book, and now I feel   that my body will benefit even more from it. I am getting ready to do the   Candida cleanse, followed by the full body cleanse. I feel so light and happy   and at peace by just eating better and knowing that it makes a very big   difference! My body is happier!<br />
  <br />
  Thank you so much Kevin for caring enough   to share your knowledge with the world.</p>

<p>Kevin Trudeau has my support. I have been sick almost all my life with   different ailments. Now I have been uplifted through his internet site. Looking   up different sources to read about and learn from has helped me and my family   out in a number of different areas. Thanks for the True Information on how to   get better and live longer.</p>

<p>Using the suggestions and information from both the website and the Natural   Cures book by Kevin Trudeau, I have managed to lose 75 lbs in the past year and   have improved my overall health.<br />
    <br />
  In fact, I have missed only one day for   sickness in the past year when most people I know missed 3 to 5 just on a single   bout of flu and I have clients, friends and family all telling me I look no   older than 38 years old. I just celebrated my 50th birthday.<br />
  <br />
  Thanks,   Kevin. You're a bright light in an otherwise dismal quest for better health for   all of us.</p>

<p>I had known for a long time something wasn't right I have gone on many yo-yo   diets but the weight keeps coming back in spades. When I heard Kevin speak on TV   it rang with some resonance. I have just recently begun changing my life but the   effects were immediate. I am resting better and I have more energy. I am hoping   the weight will follow. I have begun to walk at my pace, not a racer's pace, and   we have a trampoline I plan to try. Kevin will be a big change in the status quo   I believe. He is making a difference and hopefully he won't be silenced.</p>

<p>No book has ever influenced me more than the Natural Cures book. I am   convinced that I will have a better quality of life because of the information   here as well as live a longer, more prosperous life... no author has ever given   so much, so selflessly as Kevin Trudeau and I thank God every day that I was   home sick the day Kevin's program was on TV. It changed my life.</p>

<p>Since I read Kevin Trudeau's book, Natural Cures, I am starting a new way of   life. I am 62 years old and I got more from reading Kevin's book than I did   before. I am now starting to eat the right foods and I am starting to reverse my   diabetes so I could get off these pills. This is just the beginning of the new   way of eating and trying to get off these pills that I take that are slowly   killing me. Thank You Kevin.</p>

<p>Since reading Kevin's book I now longer have to take cholesterol, high blood   pressure or heart medications. I'm doing it with all natural herbs and things. I   am being monitored very carefully by my holistic doctor who is a DO. Thanks to   Kevin I no longer have to take prescription drugs that do as much harm if not   more than good. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
