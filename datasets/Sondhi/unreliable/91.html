                  my husband after being told by my&nbsp;fertility specialist&nbsp;at age 
                  38&nbsp;that I had no option but&nbsp;to consider adoption or donor eggs 
                  (according to&nbsp;my doctor&nbsp;I was out of eggs and gave me&nbsp; 
                  4% chance of&nbsp;getting pregnant&nbsp;and a 2% chance of carrying a baby to 
                  full term). After much research and dozens of hours reading infertility 
                  related articles and posts online, I have found your book! 
                  I never believed in anything alternative to western medicine and thought all the 
                  other stuff like&nbsp; Chinese medicine&nbsp;was a hoax. But I was soon 
                  glad to be wrong&nbsp;as I &nbsp;followed your step by step guidelines. 
                  After one month of trying I became pregnant and had a 
                  beautiful healthy boy. Nine months after that I did everything&nbsp;in your book again&nbsp;and 
                  after&nbsp;2 months of trying I got pregnant 
            again and gave birth to another perfect little boy.&nbsp;I would recommend anyone with 
            an open mind to read your book.

            get pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only it didn’t happen.&nbsp; Why? We 
            wondered after several months.&nbsp; Sure, by now I was in my 
            mid-30’s, but I was healthy and strong and had never had any 
            indication that getting pregnant would be a problem once I decided

            the losing end of our quest.&nbsp; We had never failed at anything 
            before, and let me tell you that this was not something we were 
            prepared to fail at!&nbsp; So we kept trying … and trying … and

            Infertility Drugs May Increase the Risk of Ovarian Cancer<br 
            ><br></P>
            <p class=text>A&nbsp;study had found a higher 
            rate of ovarian cancer among women who took infertility drugs (The 
            New England Journal of Medicine). The finding validates 
            &nbsp;concerns regarding these drugs that surface periodically in 
            medical journals. The study had obviously generated&nbsp;strong 
            criticism from the infertility industry, now a $1 billion-a-year 
            profit-making enterprise.</P>
            <p class=text>According to the study, 3,837 
            women who underwent infertility treatment&nbsp;between 1974 and 1985 
            in Seattle, were analyzed by Mary Anne Rossing, D.V.M., 
            Ph.D.,&nbsp;at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson 
            Cancer Research Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among all women who had taken the 
            drug Clomid (a drug which induces ovulation&nbsp;there were three 
            times more cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed within the study period 
            compared to women who had not taken drugs during 12 or more monthly

            <p class=text>Having ovarian disorders, 
            fibroids or PCOS can seriously interfere with your fertility and 
            prevent you from becoming pregnant. Since your 
            reproduction&nbsp;system&nbsp;is intelligent enough to know that 
            your internal environment is unsafe for a new baby, many women with 
            infertility issues or women that suffer from ovarian cysts, fibroids 
            and other insulin resistance/hormonal related disorders find it 
            almost impossible to get pregnant. <br><br 
            >By correctly diagnosing the root cause of your 
            infertility and reversing&nbsp;your hormonal related disorders such 
            as ovarian cysts in a timely manner, you are restoring the 
            natural&nbsp;balance of your internal reproduction environment, thus 
            make it more suitable or susceptible for pregnancy. This is the ONLY 
            way to make your internal environment suitable for a healthy 
            baby.<br><br>Moreover, 
            failing to treat your&nbsp;ovarian cysts and other insulin 
            resistance/hormonal related disorders&nbsp;&nbsp;in a timely manner, 
            can often lead to surgery. Doctors often decide to remove the 
            affected ovary or the entire uterus. This&nbsp;will obviously leave 
            you without the ability to&nbsp;have children. Ever.&nbsp;<br

            <p class=text>It is a known fact that since the

            <p class=text>Multiple pregnancy (including 
            twins) carries an increased risk of very serious consequences,

            increase their chances for getting pregnant, and to treat other

                  conceived naturally in 05,&nbsp;I unfortunately&nbsp;
