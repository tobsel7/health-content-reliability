												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> Where do the Fetal Stem Cells come from?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b> The Fetal Stem Cells come from Medra’s laboratories in Eastern Europe.
												<br>

												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> Why are Fetal Stem Cells preferable over umbilical cord stem cells?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												Fetal Stem Cells are the cellular building blocks of the 220 cell types within the body. The Fetal Stem Cells used by Medra remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue, organ or cell type within the body.
												Fetal Stem Cells also release Cytokines. Cytokines are cell-derived, hormone-like polypeptides that regulate cellular replication, differentiation, and activation. Cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function, allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted Fetal Stem Cells to repair the body. 
												<br>
												Umbilical cord stem cells are limited in number; individually not as powerful as Fetal Stem Cells nor are they as pluripotent (able to differentiate into any cell type). They usually require a familial donor to provide leukocyte (white blood cell) matching, otherwise there may be a serious or even life threatening rejection factor known as Graft Versus Host Disease. 
												A recent method of the use of umbilical cord cells is to extract a particular blood cell from the cord blood, at most approximately five hundred thousand of these blood cells and then grow them to two million blood cells to give to the patient. The problems are: firstly, they are grown to achieve the two million number and secondly it is hoped that some of the blood cells turn into a very limited number of neuronal (nerve) cells.
												On the other hand Fetal Stem Cells are not grown and in their pristine natural state, the patient receives tens of millions of each of two types of cells, both blood cells and pure neuronal (nerve) cells

												<br>
												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> How are the Fetal Stem Cells screened before their use?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												The Fetal Stem Cells selected for use in the treatment undergo elaborate testing to ensure their purity and safety. (In actuality much more extensive then would be performed on stem cells used for procedures in the United States)
												The test is called a PCR-DNA (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test, which is a laboratory process used to detect hereditary diseases, identify genetic fingerprints, diagnose infectious diseases, clone genes, and perform DNA computing. After being tested in Medra’s laboratories the cells are then sent to a world famous laboratory in Germany and are retested.

												<br>
												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> Can Fetal Stem Cells turn into cancer or tumors?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												No. While stem cells derived from an embryo only days old which are totipotent, can, in a very rare case, pose such a danger; The stem cells obtained from a fetus, (an embryo turns into a fetus at 8 weeks), at this point in development, they are pluripotent and therefore can no longer pose this potential threat.

												<br>
												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> What should I be doing before and after I receive the Fetal Stem Cell treatment?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												It is not necessary to change your regular routine either pre or post treatment. 
												Obviously, following a healthy life style such as exercise, stress reduction and proper nutrition is a good idea in general, as well as providing an environment which will maximize the Fetal Stem Cells efficacy.

												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> How quickly will I see results?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												Every person is of course different. Each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors. 
												Commonly, significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment. At times, these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment.

												<br>
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> How many Fetal Stem Cell treatments will I need?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												After the first treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will continue to proliferate and repair indefinitely. Some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite healing and progress. The decision is yours, if you decide to repeat the treatment usually a waiting period of 6 months is recommended.

												<b style="color:#336699">Question:</b> What are Dr. Rader’s qualifications?
												<br>
												<br>
												<b style="color:#22314D">Answer:</b>
												Dr. William Rader earned his medical degree at the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1967 with top honors. He was first in his medical residency class at the University of Southern California Medical Center. His medical career began in the area of psychiatry where Dr. Rader achieved great success pioneering programs for recovery from alcoholism, drug addiction and eating disorders (Bulimia and Anorexia), as well as developing the principals of the treatment program at the Betty Ford Recovery Center. For over a decade he was one of the first medical experts in the media. He opened the first HIV program in Latin America, as well as creating a successful research program to eliminate arterial plaque, in association with a major pharmaceutical company in Mexico City. 
												Dr. Rader’s medical interests shifted to Fetal Stem Cell research in 1994 when he spent a year doing due diligence in Eastern Europe and China.
												Since then he is the only American physician using Fetal Stem Cell therapy and has treated over one thousand five hundred patients.</td>
