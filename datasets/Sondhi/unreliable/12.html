    </strong><br />

In follow up testing, the majority of people even showed no more antibodies to the herpes viruses.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These medical breakthroughs and other natural cures discoveries should be front page news around the world.</strong> However, the pharmaceutical and drug companies have such a monopoly on healthcare, that you&rsquo;ll never hear the truth about these natural ways to cure and prevent disease.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the law in America and other countries forbid anyone who sells a product to state any claim as to what the product can do regarding a disease. The law in America says &ldquo;Only a drug can be used to cure, prevent or treat a disease.&rdquo; This is insane, ridiculous and outrageous. It prevents people who have natural remedies from telling you what these remedies are. </p>
<p align="center" class="lgblackfont">This is why NaturalCures.com is here. </p>
<p>When you join and become a member of NaturalCures.com, you have unbiased, truthful information about the Natural Cures and remedies being used by doctors around the world. At NaturalCures.com we accept absolutely no advertisers and do not promote or sell any supplements.

<p class="uppercaseitalic">We have no financial conflicts of interest! </p>
<p>Virtually every other health site in the world has major financial conflicts of interest. Every other health web site in the world sells advertising, sells supplements, or is owned by a multinational conglomerate such as the pharmaceutical industry to promote their own agenda.</p>
<p align="center" class="lgredfont">There is virtually no unbiased truthful information<br />
available on the web regarding health.</p>
<p>Web MD for example, is nothing more than a web site designed to promote drugs and surgery. It is owned by the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p>Natural health web sites are all designed to give you information about the benefits of the products that the owners of the web sites are promoting or selling. In many cases, the web sites use articles and news stories to convince you that certain products are good and that you should buy them. When you buy those products, the owners of the web site get financial kickbacks. </p>
<p class="uppercase">The bottom line is, there is no magazine, no newsletter, no web site that gives totally unbiased information without any financial conflicts of interest. </p>
<p><strong>NaturalCures.com is the only natural health resource in the world that is completely unbiased.</strong> We&rsquo;re not influenced by advertisers, by the desire to sell products, by any corporate ownership, or by any hidden agenda.

<p class="uppercaseitalic">If you have a question about health, come to NaturalCures.com and you will find the answer.</p>

  The information on this web site is just not from American resources. We have thousands of researchers all around the world that are constantly interviewing doctors, healthcare providers and researching books, manuscripts and studies relating to natural ways to cure and prevent disease.</p>
<p><strong>Over 90% of all the natural health information in the world has never been translated into English.</strong> There are natural remedies that have been used for hundreds of years in Russia, China, Argentina, etc that have never made its way to America or any English speaking country.</p>
<p align="center" class="lgblackfont"><strong>At NaturalCures.com we scour the globe researching and translating all of this data and making the information available to you in summarized, easy-to-read formats.</strong></p>

If you have prostate cancer, for example, you need to know about all the surgical and pharmaceutical methods that are being used, and most importantly, you need to know how effective these treatments really are. You never get the truth from the drug companies, the hospitals or clinics selling these treatments.

    One of the most important things people can do for their health is to have access to doctors and healthcare providers who do not use drugs or surgery, but rather treat their patients using natural, non-drug and non-surgical methods.

      <br />
      <span class="uppercase">    The fact is, there are millions of doctors who treat patients every day without 
  drugs and surgery. <br />
