<li class="style2">Have you ever experienced hair loss?</li>
<li class="style2">Yes?</li>
<li class="style2">Let us introduce you to hair basics first…</li>
<li class="style2">Ever wonder what is hair actually?</li></ul>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Our hair is

          consists of a type of protein called keratin. A single hair consists

          of a hair gleam, a root that exists underneath the skin, and a

          follicle, from which the hair root grows. At the lower end of the

          follicle is the hair bulb, where the hair's color pigment, or melanin,

          is formed.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Most people lose

          about 50 to 100 head hairs a day. These hairs are replaced soon after

          they are lost. They nurture back in the similar follicle on your head.

          This quantity of hair loss is absolutely normal so people who are

          experiencing such a <strong>hair loss</strong> need not to worry at all.

          Although not essential but if you're losing more than that then you

          should definitely go for a medical treatment. The therapeutic

          expression for hair loss which involves losing enough hair that a

          person has evidently thin or hairless patches is known as alopecia.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">If you have

          extraordinary hair loss and not even sure about the cause of it then

          the best idea is to see a medical therapist. A therapist can conclude

          why the hair is falling out and put forward a treatment that will

          correct the underlying problem, if necessary.</span></p>
<p class="style3 style5 style6"><font color="#073d00">

          What causes hair loss?</font></p>
<ul class="style7">
<li>According to a detailed research a number of rationales can cause hair loss like:</li>
<li>You may suddenly loose a large amount of hair after 3 to 4 month’s serious illness. </li>
<li>Hormonal problems may also cause hair loss. </li>
<li>If your thyroid gland is overactive or under active, your hair may fall out</li>
<li>Many women notice hair loss about 3 months after they've had a baby. This loss is also related to hormones. </li>
<li>Some medicines can cause hair loss. This type of hair loss improves when you stop taking the medicine. </li>
<li>Certain infections can cause hair loss. </li>
<li>Fungal infections of the scalp can cause hair loss in children. The infection is easily treated with antifungal medicines.</li>
<li>Hair loss may occur as part of an underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. Since hair loss may be an early sign of a disease, it is important to find the cause so that it can be treated.</li></ul>
<p class="style7"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">There are a number

          of factors that causes hair loss and baldness. Either the diet you

          take lacks certain vitamins or nutrients that are required for the

          active hair growth or some serious illness can also lead to excessive

          hair loss and in severe cases cause baldness.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I started

          losing hair at the age 17, tried all kinds of shampoos, Rogaine, etc

          but all went in vain. I used to have very embarrassing social life. My

          friends used to laugh at me like hell. I literally stopped getting out

          of home and my social circle vanished within no time. I had my first

          procedure with this hair tonic when my friend Theresa told me to use

          this herbal tonic and I am now shocked how great a product it is. I

          have regained my hair and not just hair in fact a very healthy and

          shiny long hair. I am very thankful to the makers of this product who

          cam up with a wonderful biological medication that made my life. <strong><font color="#008000">Peter John </font></strong>”<font color="#800000"><strong>USA</strong></font></font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">At the age of 20 I

          had hair so dense that everybody literally used to get jealous but as

          years passed by around 30yrs, I started loosing all my hair. I started

          to think about hair transplants, but observed the malicious results

          and the hair piece was a definite &quot;no-no&quot;. I almost made the grave

          mistake of considering UK’s top and most expensive hair transplant

          team whilst I was visiting UK. On my visit to Dubai I got to know of

          this herbal hair tonic which is actually doing wonders. At first I did

          not believe the billboards but then suddenly I thought of giving it a

          try. It’s just hair tonic after all. Within the very first week I

          started experiencing changes that were pretty noticeable. When time

          progressed further I got back the hair I lost indefinitely. Thanks to

          the entire team of this make! <strong><font color="#008000">Jane welkin ”</font><font color="#800000">USA</font></strong></font></span></p>

          the herbal tonic produced by this company. I used it for like 2 to 3

          months continuously and see now I have got my hair back as healthy as

          with my friend’s circle because everybody was making fun of me. Then

          one of my friends came up with this wonderful hair loss treatment
