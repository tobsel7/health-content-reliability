"Before I purchased your machine my doctor told me I needed surgery to straighten my back. Well, after<br>
using the machine for one and a half weeks it is almost unbelievable, I can actually see my back lining up and<br>
the lump I have sticking out of my back is almost gone. I cant wait for my appointment and see the look on<br>
my doctor's face when he sees me. He told me that I needed surgery to straighten it placing two wires along<br>
my spine. Thank you,it is like a small miracle. I didn't get the extended warranty and I know that if something<br>
happened to my Back2Life I'll be lost without it. Thank you."

only been three days. I'm 58 years old and have a bulging and herniated disk around L3/4/5 & S1. I am so<br>
much more limber now. Thanks from a very satisfied customer."<br>

"I purchased one of your back machines and it works wonders. I have had a disc explode twice with needed<br>
surgery twice, and 1 more exploded about a year after those surgeries. I was put on disability with severe leg<br>
pain due to nerve damage as well as in my feet, not to mention back pain. I was not able to sit, stand or<br>
sleep for very long. I weaned myself off of all the pain medication, but still suffered great pain. It gives me<br>
relaxation and does wonders for the pain. Since I received your Back2Life, my pain level has decreased, I<br>
sleep longer and better, and even sit, stand and walk for longer periods than I have in the past 5 years. I do<br>
recommend this to anyone that will listen. Thanks so much."

machine onbe month and a few days. I can now sit down longer and when I go to bed my back doesn't hurt.<br>
I feel so good and I'm not on medication at all!! Thank you."

"I bought your back 2 life machine a few weeks ago and have been using it twice a day and my wife has<br>
used it a few times too when her lower back has been bothering her. I just wanted to let you know the<br>
machine works and that it has been helping me with not having as much back pain as I use to. I just wanted<br>
to Thank You for the back 2 life machine as it really works and does what it's supposed to do for me and my<br>

"Dear Back2Life Team,<br><br>
I purchased your product about three weeks ago after seeing a late night infomercial and am a huge skeptic<br>
of things that I see on TV!<br><br>
I am writing to tell you how satisfied and amazed I am at the relief your product has brought me at minimal<br>
expense!<br><br>
I am currently 46 years old and ruptured my L5S1 disc back in the late 1980's lifting weights. I had back<br>
surgery in 1999 (Micro Discectomy) which helped temporarily until I resumed my normal active life style.<br><br>
I have been in pain for many years since re-injuring the same disc that was previously operated on and have<br>
tried everything imaginable to relieve the pain including the following.....<br><br>
1. Bought a $6,000 fully adjustable latex mattress bed with vibrating massage and the works.<br>
2. Chiropractors / Who temporarily relive pain but want you to see them three times a week.<br>
3. Neurosurgeons / Who want to operate.<br>
4. Epidurals which they have to put you in an unconscious state to administer. I hate IV's!<br>
5. Spinal decompression machines at back therapy centers.<br>
6. Cold laser treatment recently approved by the FDA<br>
7. Vicodin & Norco<br><br>
I was previously unable to sleep through the night without taking Norco or Vicodin and often woke up in the<br>
early morning hours between 3AM-5AM in pain needing to take more. After taking the second dose it was<br>
very hard to get up in the morning as I was groggy from the drugs.<br><br>
I also often would abandon my wife in the middle of the night and go sleep in another room because my<br>
tossing and turning would wake her up. I would go in the other room to suffer alone!<br><br>
Since the third treatment using the Back2Life machine I am now sleeping through the night pain free and the<br>
best part is that I quit taking pain killers all together! My liver is loving this!<br><br>
I have this miracle in my closet and can use it whenever I want!<br><br>
I no longer have to make appointments to see pain relief doctors and sit in the waiting room with a whole<br>
bunch of other people who are trapped on an endless cycle of temporary relief.<br><br>
Your product has changed my life and others that I have shared my story with that have gone on to purchase<br>
this wonderful machine! They too have had similar results!<br><br>
I am forever grateful and would be happy to be one of your on TV testimonials!!!!!<br><br>
Feel free to contact me any time or others that are skeptical!<br><br>
Thanks again from the bottom of my heart and the bottom of my happy spine!"<br>

"WOW!!!!!!! Thank you Sooo much for inventing this little Life Saver...<br>
The 2nd day I got it- I got up in the morning & put it together & got down on the floor & let it do it's thing.<br>
OH My GAWD!!!!<br>
I go to bed every night with pain in my lower back & wake up with the pain.<br>
When I was on it for less then a few second's my lower back was popping.<br>
I have Osteoarthritis in my spine & Osteoperosis & Osteoporosis in my hip's.<br>
I just wanted to let you know this lil machine is a god send.<br>
Thank you so much..<br>
Now maybe my Golf game will improve."

"I just want to tell you that "The Product" is amazing. I have had a bad back for 10 years and after having to<br>
quit my job a few years ago. After one week of using this product I can clean my home and do all kinds of<br>
stuff I could not do a week ago. It you ever need a spokesperson for this product I am more than willing to<br>
testify to the product. I am getting my life back and that means a lot I have had shots in my back to almost<br>
having surgery. But now woo hoo You have saved my life and given it back to me I can't thank you enough. I<br>
have family members that can benefit from this product and I am going to get them to buy one for themselves.<br>
Thank you Thank you."

"I watched an info commercial this morning about the Back2Life machine which is supposed to stop back<br>
pain. It's supposed to gently realign the spine and ease the tension of muscles around the spine. It sounds<br>
too good to be true, but if it really works, it could probably really help to relieve sciatica. Right now, I'm seeing<br>
a chiropractor for it but it takes a long time for results, and they're only temporary. If you know anything about<br>
the Back2Life machine, please let me know. Thanks,<br>
Deb<br><br>
Hi Deb,<br>
I just received my Back2Life machine a couple of days ago. I have severe low back pain and stiffness. I have<br>
used it several times and it does seem to work very well, I have experienced great relief. I will continue to use<br>
and let you know if my back continues to improve.<br>

"I have one and it has given me some real relief. Don't get me wrong though, the pain does come back<br>
sometimes. I do think it has really helped with my stress level. Is it worth the $220? For me it is, nothing else<br>
seems to work for me. I'm sure it's a different experience for everyone. Give it a try, if you don't like it you can<br>
send it back within 30 days."

"A long time ago I was climbing a rock wall at [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] and the bilayer got careless and just let me drop when I<br>
let go. I dropped six feet to the ground really fast and my back just wouldn't stop hurting even after three<br>
months. Then I heard About this Back2Life and I bought it. I used it a couple times and my back felt a whole<br>
lot better. I am now able to be more active."

"I've got degenerative disk disease at L5/S1, arthritic disks throughout the lumbar region, and severe<br>
impingement of both nerve roots. Was told cortisone wouldn't work and would need RF ablation, but I didn't<br>
want the invasive procedure. Wanted to try SpineMed decompression, but at $200 a session every day for a<br>
month (not covered by insurance) with no guarantee, there was no way I could do it. Have been seeing a<br>
chiropractor since 10/08 and it helped for awhile then made it worse. I received the Back2Life at the end of<br>
January. After 3 weeks, I had noticed only slight improvement. They gave me a 2 week extension (until 3/15)<br>
for no additional charge and suggested that I use ankle weights. I didn't get them, but do wear work boots<br>
for the extra weight.<br><br>
My back still bothers me some, especially when I've been working in the garden, etc., but now when it hurts,<br>
I do one or two stints on the machine and the pain is mostly gone. A miracle would have been nice, but I<br>
didn't expect one and am happy with the results. I'll be buying 2 more of them for friends and family. By the<br>
way, as someone previously mentioned, the position and movement is a standard pelvic tilt exercise that<br>
chiro's often recommend for relief of back pain. The machine does it for me, and most of the time I fall asleep<br>
on the floor while it's working. Very relaxing. No silver bullet, but combined with walking, custom orthotics in<br>
my shoes,and an occasional ice pack before using the machine when I'm really sore, my back is greatly<br>
improved.<br><br>
A few days ago I noticed that I'm not getting radiating sciatica pain (radiating down my right leg) when I get<br>
out of bed in the morning, either. So it really does work, and I don't think $200 is a lot for this kind of relief.<br>
The machine is well constructed, the literature is well written in ENGLISH, and the DVD that comes with it is<br>
really helpful. I think the company is "first class"."

"I recently purchased this machine called Back2Life which is for those suffering lower back pain from any<br>
disorder. The machine gives passive movement to the lower back and after just a few sessions on it I found it<br>
was helpful. I've been seeing a Chiro every 3 weeks for the same kind of treatment - passive movement. His<br>
machine is a little different but basically it does the same thing. It cost $199 plus tax. If anyone's interested<br>
their phone number it is 1-800-338-2190. I saw their video commercial on TV - it comes with a DVD -<br>
perhaps if you asked, they would send it beforehand so you could see how it works. You just lay on the floor<br>
and put your knees up on the thing and turn it on - it rotates in an oval kind of motion which opens the spinal<br>
area up for blood flow - the blood flow helps takes the pain away."

""I purchased the back 2 life for my shoulder pain as well as lower back pain - I am here to tell you - that after<br>
a few days of use the pain in my shoulders has gone away - my back pain which was mild has disappeared -<br>
I use it every other night for 12 minutes - and it has truly taken the pain away.<br>
This product has worked for me! I would also like to add, that at the end of the day - you lay down for 12<br>
minutes - you have no idea the amount of stress relief you feel - the stress just disappears and it relaxes you<br>
so great. If the pain is not all gone the stress is - it's fabulous for me - I relax and forget about all the days<br>
tensions in 12 minutes."

"Re: Back2Life User Testimonial.<br>
To follow up our telephone conversation this afternoon, this is the very positive and beneficial initial use<br>
experience that I had with the Back2Life machine:<br><br>
* The last two nights (Sunday and Monday), and yesterday and today's mornings (Monday and Tuesday),<br>
are the first two in many years, that I have NOT experienced ANY lower ('small area' of the back) back<br>
discomfort – after YEARS of lower back discomfort that has started while I was asleep each night, and was<br>
there when I got up – until yesterday's and today's mornings.<br>
* I attribute my relief strictly to my use of the Back2Life Machine, having completed two / twelve minute<br>
sessions yesterday (Monday), and the day before (Sunday).<br><br>
My daughter, Melissa, is a licensed and practicing Occupational Therapist. She saw your Back2Life Machine<br>
advertised on TV. She purchased it as a surprise for my wife and I, who both have back discomfort. Its use<br>
helped both of us – me most dramatically.<br><br>
I'm a retired professional pilot. I started flying in 1955, at age 16, and flew for over 50 years -- until 2006.<br>
I've enjoyed the cockpits of everything from little aircraft; to USAF Supersonic Fighters; to the Left Seat of<br>
almost every airliner from DC-9's to 747's; to Corporate Jets. Except for nightly back discomfort -- that the<br>
Back2Life has completely cured -- I've been in excellent health. The long periods of sitting as a pilot, most<br>
certainly caused my back problems.<br><br>
I can't thank your Company enough for coming up with the Back2Life. When Back2Life reworks/updates its<br>
product presentation(s), I'd love to have the opportunity to offer my "First Person" testimonial to this fantastic<br>
product.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Frank<br>
Captain, TWA"
