                    <br>
              </strong></em>Gray hair is one of the most familiar signs of 
			aging. It usually starts in late 30s and gradually increase the 
			percentage on your scalp over the next few years. The loss of hair 
			color is due to a gradual fall in melanin production in the hair 
			bulb. If you look at the hairs on a graying head you find a full 
			range of color, from the normal shade through to white along each 
			hair, and also from one hair to another. Usually people notice their 
			first gray hairs near their temples. Then the grayness spreads to 
			the crown, and later to the back of the head.  
                <p>Our hair is made up of two parts: a shaft - the colored part 
				we see growing out of our heads and a root - the bottom part, 
				which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp</p>
                <p>The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by hair 
				follicle. Each hair follicle contains a certain number of 
				pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a 
				chemical called melanin that gives the growing shaft of hair its 
				color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. </p>
                <p>Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or 
				darker. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how 
				much melanin each hair contains. </p>
                <p>There are several reasons for gray hair and these vary from 
				one person to another pending on one's age. The most common 
				reason is heredity, the other big reason for graying hair is the 
				environment, a recent study indicates that smokers are 4 times 
				more likely to become prematurely gray (or bald). Among younger 
				people, vitamin B-12 deficiency, thyroid imbalance, anemia or 
				viruses can also lead to gray hair. </p>
                <p>As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles 
				gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair 
				follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much 
				melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, 
				silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, 
				fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. 
				Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. By combining 
				traditional oriental herbal medicine theory and current 
				scientific breakthrough, Reminex research team discovered by 
				reviving dormant or sometimes nearly dead pigment cells, they 
				are able to prolong the natural hair color stage for older 
				people and prevent premature gray hair or white hair in younger 
				people.</p>
