                    <br>

              <p><em><strong>How do I know if Reminex GH will work for me?</strong></em><br>
                Preliminary studies indicate that Reminex GH is effective to 
				restore gray hair or premature white hair with an 70% success 
				rate in both men and women. Remember individual results may vary 
				and how soon you notice the desired results depends on many 
				other factors, such as diet, stress level, smoking, etc. The 
				shorter the period of time that you have had gray hair and the 
				less percentage of gray hair you have on your scalp, the faster 
				you will notice a difference. You did not become gray in one or 
				two months, therefore there is no miracle pill to restore your 
				hair color back to the original color in 2 to 6 months. It takes 
				time, just like everything else, but once the desired result is 
				achieved, then you do not need to worry about gray hair any 
				more.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Is Reminex GH FDA approved?</strong></em><br>
                The Food &amp; Drug Administration does not have an approval process 
				for any nutritional supplements, only prescription medications. 
				All of Reminex GH's ingredients voluntarily comply with the 
				FDA's GRAS safety requirements and it is manufactured by a FDA 
				approved facility in the US.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Does Reminex GH have any side effects?</strong></em><br>
                When used as directed, there are no known side effects</p>
              <p><em><strong>Can I order Reminex GH from outside the United 
				States?</strong></em><br>
                Yes, we can ship Reminex GH internationally to most countries. 
				If you are unsure whether your country’s customs laws permit the 
				importation of Reminex GH, please contact us prior to placing 
				your order. Please be aware that there may be a slight delay for 
				customs clearance in some foreign countries.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Why I have to take Reminex GH for 6 months before I 
				can notice the results?</strong></em><br>
                Reminex GH formula helps to stimulate melancocytes to increase 
				body’s ability to produce melanin pigment, which overcomes the 
				genetically based tendency to produce less or little melanin. 
				Hair color is determined by a pigment known as melanin that's 
				distributed through the middle of the hair shaft. The range of 
				color, from blond to brown to black, is determined by the 
				number, size, and, needless to say, color of the pigment 
				granules. When hair is produced by the reproduction of the 
				epithelial cells comprising the follicle, newly produced melanin 
				accumulates in the cells and colors the hair itself as it 
				emerges from the follicle. It is a gradual process. Just like 
				you did not become gray overnight, you cannot get rid of gray 
				hair in overnight. 70% men and women who have used Reminex GH 
				responded to the formula, the average time of seeing noticeable 
				result being 6 to 9 months.</p>
              <p><em><strong>What happens if I stop taking Reminex GH, will my 
				gray hair come back?</strong></em><br>
                This is a common concern, and the answer varies by individual. 
				Some customers report no gray after a significant period of time 
				of disuse. Most customers start to see their gray hair return, 
				more slowly, within a year of cessation of Reminex GH use. 
				Generally, younger person have better results discontinuing 
				Reminex GH use without a return to their previous state than 
				older persons. We encourage all users to resume taking Reminex 
				GH as the hair returns gray to maintain the achieved results.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Does Reminex GH change color of my beard or 
				mustache?</strong></em><br>
                Yes, Reminex GH formula works throughout your body, but color 
				changes to the beard or mustache is much slower.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Do I need to use a special shampoo while using 
				Reminex GH?</strong></em><br>
                Reminex GH scientists have created Reminex Shampoo for gray hair 
				which helps to restore gray hair to its original hair color and 
				remove yellow tone of the hair and add body and thickness to the 
				hair each time it is used. It supplements the effects of Reminex 
				GH gray hair vitamin by providing proper nutrients to hair 
				follicles and creating a healthy environment for healthy hair 
				growth.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Can I send in a money order or personal check for 
				my order?</strong></em><br>

				description of your order and shipping option to:</p>
