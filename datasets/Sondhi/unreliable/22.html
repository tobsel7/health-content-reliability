    <b><font size="2">New Advances in Alcoholism Treatment</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <br>
    More than 700,000 Americans receive alcoholism treatment on any given day. 
    However, the techniques of alcoholism therapy have traditionally been based 
    on clinical experience and intuition, with little rigorous validation of 
    their effectiveness. Over the past 20 years, modern methods of evaluating 
    medical therapies have been increasingly applied to alcoholism treatment. 
    These methods include the use of control groups for comparison purposes, 
    random assignment of study participants to different treatment groups and, 
    to the greatest extent possible, follow-up of all patients who entered the 
    study. This issue focuses on the results of recent controlled clinical 
    studies on the effectiveness of self-help groups, psychosocial approaches, 
    and medications in achieving and maintaining abstinence.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Twelve-Step Self-Help Programs<br>
    </b><br>
    Self-help groups are the most commonly sought source of help for 
    alcohol-related problems. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), one of the most 
    commonly known self-help groups, outlines 12 consecutive activities, or 
    steps, that alcoholics should achieve during the recovery process. 
    Alcoholics can become involved with AA before entering professional 
    treatment, as a part of it, or as aftercare following professional 
    treatment. Although AA appears to produce positive outcomes in many of its 
    members, its efficacy has rarely been assessed in randomized clinical 
    trials.<br>
    <br>
    One randomized study of patients entering employee assistance programs 
    compared inpatient treatment combined with AA with referral to AA alone. 
    This study found that inpatient treatment, a combination of professional 
    treatment and AA, will achieve better results for more people than AA alone. 
    Ouimette and colleagues, as part of a nonrandomized observational study 
    involving 3,000 patients in Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, 
    compared predominantly 12-step programs with predominantly 
    cognitive-behavioral programs as well as with courses of therapy that 
    combined both approaches. In cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the 
    therapist helps the client learn new skills to cope with problems and to 
    change harmful behavior patterns, such as alcohol abuse. One year after 
    completion of treatment, the three types of programs had produced comparable 
    improvements on measures of alcohol consumption and related problems. 
    However, participants in the 12-step programs achieved more sustained 
    abstinence and higher rates of employment compared with participants in the 
    other two programs. Interpretation of these results is complicated by the 
    nonrandom assignment of patients to the different treatment types.<br>
    <br>
    The beneficial effects of AA may be attributable in part to the replacement 
    of the participant's social network of drinking friends with a fellowship of 
    AA members who can provide motivation and support for maintaining 
    abstinence. In addition, AA's approach often results in the development of 
    coping skills, many of which are similar to those taught in more structured 
    psychosocial treatment settings, thereby leading to reductions in alcohol 
    consumption.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Psychosocial Therapy</b><br>
    <br>
    The following sections deal with selected recent approaches or 
    considerations relevant to the psychosocial treatment of alcohol-related 
    problems.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Motivational Enhancement Therapy</b><br>
    <br>
    Developed specifically for Project MATCH,1 motivational enhancement therapy 
    (MET) begins with the assumption that the responsibility and capacity for 
    change lie within the client. The therapist begins by providing 
    individualized feedback about the effects of the patient's drinking. Working 
    closely together, therapist and patient explore the benefits of abstinence, 
    review treatment options, and design a plan to implement treatment goals. 
    Analysis suggests that MET may be one of the most cost-effective of 
    available treatment methods. In one study, the motivational interviewing 
    technique-a key component of MET-was shown to overcome patients' reluctance 
    to enter treatment more effectively than did conventional techniques.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Couples Therapy</b><br>
    <br>
    Evidence indicates that involvement of a nonalcoholic spouse in a treatment 
    program can improve patient participation rates and increase the likelihood 
    that the patient will alter drinking behavior after treatment ends.<br>
    <br>
    There are various approaches to marital family therapy. Behavioral-marital 
    therapy (BMT) combines a focus on drinking with efforts to strengthen the 
    marital relationship through shared activities and the teaching of 
    communication and conflict evaluation skills. O'Farrell and colleagues 
    combined couples therapy with the learning and rehearsal of a relapse 
    prevention plan. Among alcoholics with severe marital and drinking problems, 
    the combination approach produced improved marital relations and higher 
    abstinence rates through 30 months of follow-up compared with patients 
    undergoing only BMT.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Brief Interventions</b><br>
    <br>
    Many persons with alcohol-related problems receive counseling from primary 
    care physicians or nursing staff in the context of five or fewer standard 
    office visits. Such treatment, known as brief intervention, generally 
    consists of straightforward information on the negative consequences of 
    alcohol consumption along with practical advice on strategies and community 
    resources to achieve moderation or abstinence. Two controlled trials in the 
    United States and Canada demonstrated that this approach reduced drinking, 
    alcohol-related problems, and patients' use of health care services. Most 
    brief interventions are designed to help those at risk for developing 
    alcohol-related problems to reduce their alcohol consumption. 
    Alcohol-dependent patients are encouraged to enter specialized treatment 
    with the goal of complete abstinence.<br>
    <br>
    The brief intervention approach has also been successfully applied outside 
    the primary care setting. Evidence suggests that 25 to 40 percent of trauma 
    patients may be alcohol dependent. Gentilello and colleagues conducted a 
    randomized controlled study among patients in a trauma center who had 
    detectable blood alcohol levels at the time of admission. The researchers 
    found that a single motivational interview at or near the time of discharge 
    reduced drinking levels and re-admission for trauma during 6 months of 
    follow-up. Monti and colleagues conducted a similar randomized controlled 
    study among youth ages 18 to 19 admitted to an emergency room with 
    alcohol-related injuries. After 6 months, although all participants had 
    decreased their alcohol consumption, the group receiving brief intervention 
    had a significantly lower incidence of drinking and driving, traffic 
    violations, alcohol-related injuries, and alcohol-related problems.<br>
    <br>
    Brief intervention among freshman college students previously identified as 
    being at high risk for harmful consequences of heavy drinking has been shown 
    to result in a significant decline in alcohol-related problems.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Treating Alcohol and Nicotine Addiction Together</b><br>
    <br>
    Nicotine and alcohol interact in the brain, each drug possibly affecting 
    vulnerability to dependence on the other. Consequently, some researchers 
    postulate that treating both addictions simultaneously might be an 
    effective, even essential, way to help reduce dependence on both. A recent 
    study by Hurt and colleagues showed that treatment for nicotine dependence 
    did not interfere with abstinence from alcohol or other drugs. Furthermore, 
    such concurrent treatment not only enhanced cessation from smoking, it also 
    did not induce already abstinent smokers to relapse to drinking.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2"><br>
    <b>Pharmacotherapy</b><br>
    <br>
    More recently, research has focused on the development of medications for 
    blocking alcohol-brain interactions that might promote alcoholism. In 1995 
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the medication 
    naltrexone (ReViaTM) as an aid in preventing relapse among recovering 
    alcoholics who are simultaneously undergoing psychosocial therapy. This 
    approval was based largely on two randomized controlled studies that showed 
    decreased alcohol consumption for longer periods in naltrexone-treated 
    patients compared with those who received a placebo.<br>
    <br>
    As is the case with all diseases, however, naltrexone is only effective if 
    taken on a regular basis. Like all medications, naltrexone has side effects. 
    One recent study reported a high rate of side effects, which probably 
    explains why this study, in contrast with most other studies, failed to find 
    naltrexone effective.<br>
    <br>
    Acamprosate showed promise in treating alcoholism in several randomized 
    controlled European trials involving more than 3,000 alcoholic subjects who 
    were also undergoing psychosocial treatment. Analysis of combined results 
    showed that more than twice as many alcoholics receiving acamprosate 
    remained abstinent up to 1 year compared with subjects receiving 
    psychosocial treatment alone.<br>
    <br>
    Research suggests that some medications may be more effective for certain 
    types of alcoholics. For example, when ondansetron (Zofran®) was combined 
    with psychotherapy, alcoholics who had begun drinking heavily before age 25 
    (i.e., early-onset alcoholics) decreased their alcohol consumption and 
    increased their number of abstinent days, but later onset alcoholics did 
    not. Sertraline (Zoloft®), in contrast, appears to reduce drinking in 
    late-onset, but not early-onset, alcoholics. However, fluoxetine (Prozac®), 
    a medication related to sertraline, has not been found to be effective in 
    late-onset alcoholism.<br>
    <br>
    In conclusion, research supports the concept of using medications as an 
    adjunct to the psychosocial therapy of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 
    However, additional clinical trials are required to identify those patients 
    most likely to benefit from such an approach, to determine the most 
    appropriate medications for different patient types, to establish optimal 
    dosages, and to develop strategies for enhancing patient compliance with 
    medication regimens.</font></p>

    <b>New Advances in Alcoholism Treatment-A Commentary by NIAAA Director Enoch 
    Gordis, M.D.</b><br>
    <br>
    Alcoholism clinicians have access today to a wide range of treatment options 
    for their patients. Some of these treatments, such as 12-step self-help 
    programs, have been around a long time. Others-including brief intervention 
    and various therapies borrowed from other fields, such as motivational 
    enhancement therapy and couples therapy-are relatively new concepts that 
    have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk for alcohol-related 
    problems. The key change that has occurred, of course, is the advent of 
    alcoholism clinical research, which over the past 15 years or so has made 
    significant progress toward rigorous evaluation of both existing therapies 
    and newly developed therapies for use in treating alcohol-related problems. 
    Finally, continued research on alcohol's effects in the brain and on the 
    links between brain and behavior, which has already led to the development 
    of medications to reduce craving, is likely to provide clinicians with a 
    range of highly specific medications that will, when used in conjunction 
    with behavioral therapies, improve the chance for recovery-and the lives-of 
    those who suffer from alcohol abuse and dependence.<br>
    <br>
    1Project MATCH is a national, multisite, randomized clinical trial that 
    produced data on the outcomes of specific alcoholism treatment approaches.</font></p>
