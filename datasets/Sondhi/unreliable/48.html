      <h3><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why Do We 
        Need Supplements?</font></h3>
                    <p><font size="4">The discovery and development of <u>FoodMatrix&#8482;</u> 
                      nutrients represents one of the most significant nutritional 
                      breakthroughs of our modern world. This new technology has 
                      revolutionized our thinking regarding the provision of effective 
                      nutritional supplementation. These FoodMatrix&#8482; nutrients 
                      are fundamentally different from other supplemental products, 
                      which have been sold on the world markets for many decades. 
                      FoodMatrix&#8482; nutrients are 21st century products which 
                      help the current needs of a civilization which is largely 
                      malnourished. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Recent statistics have shown that 1 in every 3 adults 
        and 1 in every 5 young adults are taking some nutritional supplementation 
        on a regular basis. It is imperative then, to choose those supplements, 
        which are the most effective for our needs. We must choose products that 
        promote biochemical balance and not those which are either ineffective 
        or which can block the normal metabolic processes in the body.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Many people believe that they get all the nutrients they 
        need from the food they eat. There is now, however, a widespread understanding 
        that with the mineral depletion of our soils, food processing, poor food 
        choices and unwise eating habits, most people are not eating a wholesome 
        or adequate diet. Today, people take supplements to provide sources of 
        concentrated nutrients, all with the view to maintaining health and vitality 
        and keeping dreaded diseases at bay.</font></p>
      <h3><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are isolated 
        chemical vitamins and minerals?</font> </h3>
                    <p><font size="4">The countless brands of vitamins and minerals available 
                      today at health food stores all use isolated chemical USP 
                      (United States Pharmacopoeia) nutrients. In our modern world, 
                      we have become used to the bio-medical model. This model 
                      is reductionistic in its point of departure and believes 
                      that in general terms, medications and nutrients should 
                      be given as single isolated substances. Nutrients are removed 
                      from their natural environment and presented as a synthesized 
                      single chemical. As an example, ascorbic acid is never isolated 
                      in nature, but occurs in a <u>Food Matrix&#8482;</u>, molecularly 
                      bonded to other food elements including Bioflavonoids, proteins, 
                      carbohydrates and lipids. This food form is just what the 
                      body requires to process the nutrients. On the other hand, 
                      the body has difficulty in recognizing and processing the 
                      chemically isolated forms. The digestive process requires 
                      a delivery system where nutrients are taken from the gut 
                      into serum (the blood) so that they can be utilized appropriately. 
                      The delivery system is dependent on proteins to provide 
                      the vehicle for transport. Because isolated chemicals are 
                      not bound to protein, they are poorly absorbed and bioavailability 
                      is retarded. The absorption factor for most chemical isolates 
                      is in the area of 5% and very rarely exceeds 20%. This may 
                      be the reason that many scientists and doctors have suggested 
                      that taking large amounts of supplements is only useful 
                      for producing expensive urine.</font> </p>

      <p><font size="4">Absorption is an over used and often abused word. Most 
        people who take food supplements are sold on the idea that one brand are 
        better absorbed than another. Absorption, however, is not the complete 
        story. Bioavailability covers absorption, retention, assimilation and 
        utilization. Unless the supplement is high in all of these factors, the 
        real benefit to our body can be very low. There is little benefit if the 
        isolated nutrient, having been absorbed into the blood stream, cannot 
        be assimilated by a solid organ such as the liver. If it is not assimilated, 
        it cannot be retained or utilized on demand.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Manufacturers typically claim better absorption, retention, 
        and bioavailability for their products. For the most part, however, their 
        scientific backup and research is missing. Claims regarding the advantages 
        of FoodMatrix&#8482; nutrients are based on scientific facts, not science 
        fiction.</font></p>

                        <p><font size="4">Dr. Massoud Arvanaghi, the scientist 
                          responsible for the manufacture of <u>FoodMatrix&#8482;</u> 
                          nutrients, has examined the technical comparison of

                          nutrients they need from food sources. Attempts to <br>
                          improve on this basic principal by concentrating the<br>
                          elements in food into single actives (such as ascorbic<br>
                          acid) or into fractions that are considered to be the

                          valuable, have not yielded the beneficial effects that<br>
                          were expected. Isolated substances (health food/drug 
                          store<br>
                          vitamins/minerals) cannot compare in value to food or<br>
                          FoodMatrix&trade; nutrients and this has been well demonstrated<br>
                          through scientific research . . .<br>

                          own in the body and they do not simply wander about<br>
                          looking for an appropriate destination site. Nutrients<br>
                          are targeted by a transportation system whereby protein 
                          <br>
                          chaperones deliver nutrients to the exact location for<br>

      <p><font size="4">This means that isolated chemical nutrients (health food/drug 
        store type) may be absorbed, but when they enter the body, there is no 
        mechanism to target their delivery. The body does not recognize them. 
        So, they are either deposited in the wrong places, which causes problems, 
        or they are flushed right back out of the body.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">FoodMatrix&#8482; nutrients, on the other hand, are delivered 
        by the protein chaperones to the cells that need the nutrients and, more 
        specifically, to the right sites within the cell.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Nutrients occur naturally as complex food compounds and 
        it is in this form that they best support the body&#8217;s processes. 
        Isolated chemical nutrients (health food/drug store vitamins/minerals) 
        are foreign to the body. Their effectiveness is vastly inferior to their 
        natural counterparts and there is some evidence that they may even confuse 
        or over ride the natural processes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Let us take examples and see the benefits of FoodMatrix&#8482; 
        nutrients. Calcium is traditionally very difficult to absorb and use in 
        the human body. If, for example, you give calcium carbonate as a supplement 
        for calcium deficiency, there are a number of difficulties. First, you 
        need to give a large amount just to get a little benefit. 1000mg of calcium 
        carbonate yields 400mg of elemental or actual calcium. Of this 400mg, 
        it would be fortunate if 5% is absorbed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">This means that with 1000mg of calcium carbonate, we end 
        up with about 20mg (5% of 400mg) of calcium absorbed. Secondly, it has 
        not been determined that the calcium is correctly utilized. Because it 
        is an inorganic chemical, which comes from the soil, it is not bound to 
        a protein and therefore it is not properly targeted in the body. We know 
        that this type of calcium tends to clog arteries and cause arteriosclerosis 
        and also ends up as deposits in the colon or kidneys.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">FoodMatrix&#8482; calcium is bound to protein and research 
        has shown between 70% to 90% absorption. Because it is bound to the protein 
        chaperone, it is targeted for appropriate utility.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Scientists under the leadership of Professor J. Vinson 
        of Scranton University showed that:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="4">FoodMatrix&trade; calcium was 300% better absorbed than 
          Isolated form.<br>
          </font><font size="4">FoodMatrix&trade; calcium showed a significant 
          reduction (7.7% diastolic)<br>
          in blood pressure when Inorganic calcium had no effect.</font></p>
