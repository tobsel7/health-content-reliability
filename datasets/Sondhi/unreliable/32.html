              Success Stories From Our Customer </span><br>
              <br>
              Noticing my gray hair was very difficult for me. I am a sales 
			executive for Pepsi Cola and I am in contact with customers every 
			day. I felt people were paying special attention to my hair. I tried 
			different gels, sprays, shampoos and pills but it seems that nothing 
			worked for me. When my friend told me about Reminex GH, I thought I 
			would give it a try. What can I lose. After only three months, the 
			gray hair near my temple area is gone, I mean “GONE”. A couple of 
			months later, my barber told me that I had dyed my hair somewhere 
			else. When I told her I did not, she did not believe me. I have had 
			so much more confidence while going about my work. About 60% of my 
			gray hair was gone after only eight months with Reminex. It is 
			unbelievable yet it is happening.
                <p>It was quick and easy to restore my gray hair. That is the 
				first issue. No more messy dyes! I now have more confidence, I 
				feel different, more energetic and alive. What is more is 
				maintaining the results! And, Reminex GH has done that for me.&quot; <em><strong><br>

                <p>Before taking Reminex GH supplements, I was using another 
				brand. I was getting more and more gray hair every day. Since I 
				have been taking Reminex GH, I have seen a significant reduction 
				in my gray hair. I am really happy with the results and feel I 
				am much younger. <br>

                <p>I LOVE this stuff!!!!!!!!!!! This product is AWESOME!!!! I 
				have wasted so much money on other products with lame results. 
				When I stumbled across your web site I was looking for info on 
				Gray hair and it's cause. Thank God I learned about Reminex GH! 
				I'm telling anyone and everyone about Reminex GH! THANK YOU. <br>

                <p> I have had gray hair for many years and after less than 4 
				months my gray hair definitely became much less. I am glad I 
				gave Reminex GH a try. I am glad that I won't have to keep 
				searching for topical products that don't work. I am saving 
				money by using Reminex GH supplements. I am so happy I 
				discovered Reminex GH on the internet. God bless you. I will not 
				be running from one product to another ever again. Thank you. <br>

                  <em><strong>Debra Mezasson, 52 from Scottsdale, AZ.</strong></em></p>
                <p> I just discovered your website and product and I think it is 
				certainly worth a try to see if it can help. From what I have 
				read, it seems to be better than the alternatives because it 
				works naturally with your body and treats the underlying problem 
				rather than the symptom. <br>
                  <em><strong>                  - Randy Dobbs, retired 
				professor, new York City, New York.</strong></em></p>
                <p> I feel very fortunate to have discovered this product and as 
				a business owner who has to be around people, and be the sales 
				manager I feel so much more confident now that my grey hair has 
				diminished significantly, only after six months of use. Thanks 
				and keep up the good work. <br>
                  <em><strong>                  - Todd Duncan, 40 from 
				Cleveland. OH. </strong></em></p>
                <p>I found Reminex GH on the internet. I began taking it, and at 
				the end of the third bottle I knew this stuff really worked. My 
				gray hair became less and I could see fewer gray hair growing 
				out. I am looking better and younger and for the first time in 
				over 6 years I feel confident with my appearance knowing that it 
				will stay this way. Nothing has ever reduced my gray hair this 
				well.&quot; <br>

				city, California. </strong></em></p>
                <p>I would just like to say that I find your website and 
				information extraordinary. You guys seem to be more than just a 
				&quot;money making&quot; company. I feel that you really want to help, and 
				so far, ALL OF THE PRODUCTS I have gotten from you are REALLY 
				GREAT. So, thank you. I really appreciate all the wonderful 
				information I have gotten from your website, and I appreciate 
				your honesty. I trust your website and would recommend it. <br>
                  - <em><strong>                  Larry Hall, London, UK </strong></em></p>
                <p>Reminex GH is definitely worth a try. I have seen great 
				improvement with my appearance, and I am waiting to be gray hair 
				free. And Thank you to the producers of Reminex GH for something 
				so positive and life changing. <br>
                  - <em><strong>                  Dave Rothberg, Las Vegas, NV </strong></em></p>
                <p>I would recommend everybody to purchase this product because 
				I believe this product is safe, effective, and reasonably priced 
				and more important, it works. <em><strong><br>
                  - Chris Hillcrest, 54, Jersey City, NJ </strong></em></p>
                <p>I HIGHLY recommend this product for gray hair . I had 
				moderate gray hair, and after using it for 4 months, I already 
				noticed the difference! I have been using it for 6 months now, 
				and it's great. Since I started Reminex GH, my gray hair has 
				become less and less! <br>
                  <em><strong>                  - Jean Simon, Paris, France.</strong></em> </p>
                <p>With a money back guarantee, you have nothing to lose and 
				everything to gain. People usually look for the 'magic pill' 
				that will cure everything and do it in a matter of hours. This 
				supplement is no such thing, it takes time and patience. 
				However, after a month of taking Reminex GH, I've seen a drastic 
				reduction of my gray hair and I'm very happy with its results so 
				far. <br>
                  <em><strong>- Garry Finland, Sydney, Australia. </strong></em></p>
                <p>This is the best treatment I have ever used in the 7 years or 
				so that I have had gray hair . I have used every single over the 
				counter and prescription medication available. None of them were 
				as effective and they all had some side effect. <br>
                  - <em><strong>                  Terry Mull, Yorkshire, UK.</strong></em> </p>
                <p>I am glad we gave Reminex GH a try. My daughter had amazing 
				results in less that 3 months and now is maintaining the results 
				for over 9 months already. <br>
                  - <em><strong>                  Sara Casey, 56, Tampa, Fl </strong></em></p>
                <p>Thanks again for your help, Your guys definitely need to 
				promote your product more, I believe you could help many people. 
				I have recommended several to your site, and I'm sure they will 
				try it from the rave reviews I've given them. But do you know 
				what? When you find a product that works, it's like a huge 
				weight being lifted off your shoulders. Thanks. <br>
                  - <em><strong>                  Jason Rogers, BC, Canada. </strong></em></p>
                <p>Reminex GH worked well. This product is cheap and effective. <br>
                  - <em><strong>                  Gail Jackson, 62, from Boston,

                <p>Thank you and thank you again. I have gained new confidence. 
				I have had gray hair since 21 and I tried everything and nothing 
				worked. Reminex GH is the one. <br>
