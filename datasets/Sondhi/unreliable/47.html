                      With recent statistics revealing that 1 in every 3 adults 
                      and 1 in every 5 young adults (ages 15 to 25) are taking 
                      some type of nutritional supplementation on a regular basis, 
                      it makes sense for us to purchase supplements that are the 
                      most effective (including the cost factor) for our needs.

                      We all recognize that we should get all of these essential 
                      vitamins and minerals from good organic (wholesome) food.&nbsp; 
                      However, with mineral depletion of the soil, environmental 
                      issues, processed foods, and demands on growers etc, most 
                      of us admit that we take supplements because we want that 
                      additional preventative or protective security factor.&nbsp; 
                      <br>
                      If we admit that the best source of proper vitamins and 
                      minerals are contained in food then ideally our supplements 
                      should also be in a food form. </font></p>

                      were then isolated from a natural source , or the vitamin 
                      molecules were constructed from a commercially available 
                      source like glucose.&nbsp; In both cases, however, all the 
                      constituents that naturally are attached to the vitamin 
                      are eliminated and the bioavailability and utility of the 
                      vitamin is reduced.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like discovering that 
                      the engine of a car is the active ingredient, but the engine 
                      of a car is useless without gas, wheels, controls, and bodywork.&nbsp; 
                      Until recently, scientists thought that vitamins were mysteriously 
                      detached from their food proteins in the digestive system 
                      and were then somehow re-attached to proteins after absorption.&nbsp; 
                      We now know that this does not happen and that the proteins 
                      always remain attached.&nbsp; Vitamins and minerals must 
                      be consumed in a true food form for optimal efficiency and 
                      effectiveness.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s where FoodMatrix&#8482; 
                      nutrients come in.</font></p>

                    You Don&#8217;t Know...</font></h2><blockquote>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4">We all know that we aren't eating 
                    properly, and that the heavily processed foods that we do 
                    eat don't give enough nutrition. That's why 60 to 70% of us 
                    use some form of supplement. But it's what we DON'T know that 
                    can hurt us. Major pharmaceutical companies have kept the 
                    truth from us all. In fact these Mega Drug companies went 
                    to court to make sure you did not hear the truth! <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    You see, over 90% of all the vitamins and minerals available 
                    in the thousands of supplements you buy come from the same 
                    handful of Mega Drug companies. They isolate the vitamins 
                    and recreate them in a laboratory in huge quantities and sell 
                    them to vitamin manufacturers. They also have minerals dug 
                    up in mines all over the world and these crushed rocks are 
                    what you get in your fortified O.J., breakfast cereal or daily 
                    vitamin. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    What you may not know is that these chemicals and rocks are 
                    not recognized as nutrition by the body and can in some cases 
                    be toxic. Yes, in trying to do your body some good you may 
                    be causing real harm. These chemicals and rocks floating around 
                    in your bloodstream are a recipe for disaster. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Nutrients found in food are recognized by the body, and the 
                    body uses them for nourishment. These complex nutrients are 
                    in the form of a food matrix with vitamins and minerals bound 
                    to proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, enzymes and bioflavanoids. 
                    These nutrients in a food matrix, not isolated chemicals, 
                    are what the body considers food. Scientists have developed 
                    a way to work with nature to produce FoodMatrix&#8482; nutrients, 
                    a real food vitamin mineral combination that has all of the 
                    important cofactors bound to the vitamins and minerals your 
                    body needs. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    To get an idea of how well these nutrients work, researchers 
                    at Scranton University tested the effectiveness of FoodMatrix&#8482; 
                    nutrients and chemical isolates on baby mammals.</font></p>
                  <p align="center"><font size="4"><img src="http://www.thefightdiabetes.com/images/matrixgraph.gif" alt="the effectiveness of FoodMatrix&#8482;" width="326" height="176"></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4">After feeding them nutrient deficient 
                    food for two weeks they began feeding one group isolates and 
                    the other FoodMatrix&trade; nutrients for four weeks weighing them 
                    and charting the progress. These babies, whose cells were 
                    screaming for nutrition received no benefit from the isolated 
                    nutrients . As a matter of fact, their weight soon began to 
                    decline. In contrast the FoodMatrix&trade; group thrived , and their 
                    weight almost doubled in the four-week period. This study 
                    clearly shows that isolated nutrients give very little or 
                    no help to growing cells. Consider that our cells need to 
                    grow and flourish for our bodies to heal, grow stronger and 
                    fight off the ravages of time. Which type of nutrient are 
                    you going to feed your cells? <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    To be effectively used by the body, vitamins need cofactors. 
                    These &quot;helpers&quot; consist of bioflavanoids and other 
                    natural substances that work with the vitamin to produce positive 
                    results. Without these cofactors the effects of mass produced 
                    isolated chemicals are minimal at best. Take vitamin C for 
                    example. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <img src="http://www.thefightdiabetes.com/images/matrixgraph2.gif" alt="FoodMatrix Vitamin C" width="315" height="167" align="right">In 
                    a study conducted at the New Jersey College of Medicine there 
                    was five times more FoodMatrix&trade; Vitamin C in the blood after 
                    two hours, and an incredible eighteen times as much after 
                    twelve hours. Surprisingly there was more Vitamin C from FoodMatrix&trade; after twenty-four hours than there was at any time with the 
                    isolated Ascorbic Acid group.<img src="http://www.thefightdiabetes.com/images/matrixgraph3.gif" alt="The superiority of real food nutrients" width="194" height="190" align="left"><br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4">Further proof of the superiority 
                    of real food nutrients is a study released by Scranton University. 
                    Using tissue samples, the bioavailability of FoodMatrix&#8482; 
                    and Ascorbic Acid were measured. The results were astounding! 
                    FoodMatrix&#8482; Vitamin C was found to be over twelve times 
                    more bioavailable than the isolate.</font></p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4"><img src="http://www.thefightdiabetes.com/images/coloncancer.gif" alt="Colon Cancer" width="172" height="113" align="right"><br>
                    <u>Colon Cancer</u> kills 47,000 Americans every year. This 
                    dreaded disease is generally believed to develop from polyps. 
                    These growths were studied to determine a patient&#8217;s 
                    risk for cancer.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4"><br>
                    While numerous studies have shown that Vitamin C can STOP 
                    further polyp growth, a study conducted at The University 
                    of Dublin Trinity College revealed that FoodMatrix&#8482; 
                    Vitamin C REDUCED polyps by more than 50% in just 30 days! 
                    Clearly FoodMatrix&trade; nutrients are vastly superior to isolates. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Another critical aspect of the benefit this new biotechnology 
                    is the way minerals are transported in the body. Nobel Prize 
                    winning science proves that there is a systematic process 
                    the body uses to transport minerals directly to the cells. 
                    Without the special protein &quot;chaperone&quot; found in 
                    FoodMatrix&trade; nutrients the crushed rock minerals found in virtually 
                    all supplements end up floating aimlessly in the blood. Scientists 
                    are just beginning to understand the deadly consequences of 
                    these free-floating minerals. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Calcium is a prime example of how dangerous these minerals 
                    can be. Calcium supplements are taken by millions of women. 
                    Even though American women take more calcium supplements than 
                    anywhere else in the world we have one of the highest rates 
                    of osteoporosis. This deadly condition known as &quot;brittle 
                    bone disease&quot; causes holes in the bone that can lead 
                    to crippling fractures and often death. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <img src="http://www.thefightdiabetes.com/images/coloncancer2.gif" alt="Softening of the bone" width="171" height="105" align="right">In 
                    the adjacent photo, you can see a compression fracture of 
                    the spine caused by advanced softening of the bone. Unfortunately 
                    taking most calcium tablets does little to help the problem, 
                    and can cause deadly side effects.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4"><br>
                    Without the protein transport to shuttle the calcium directly 
                    to the proper tissues, calcium carbonate (which is simply 
                    crushed limestone) can bind to a variety of tissues with deadly 
                    results. This calcium can find its way into the breasts and 
                    kidneys. Even more deadly it may end up in the walls of your 
                    arteries where it causes hardening and thickening. This calcium 
                    plaque is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke. 
                    Take a look at the difference between a normal coronary artery 
                    and one that has become clogged with calcium plaque. </font></p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="http://www.thefightdiabetes.com/images/coloncancer3.gif" alt="Clogged Arteries" width="549" height="132"></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4">It's easy to see why Americans 
                    by the thousands are lining up to be examined by new state 
                    of the art scanners that can detect this lethal calcification 
                    of their arteries.&nbsp; <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    What you don't know can hurt you! These mega drug companies 
                    have fought to keep these facts a secret from all of us. Their 
                    laboratory made chemicals and crushed rocks have a minimal 
                    health benefit at best, and can cause real harm. Now that 
                    we know the truth, it is up to us to spread the good news. 
                    There is a healthier and safer way to feed your body. Working 
                    WITH nature we can help the body to have a fighting chance 
                    against over processed foods, noxious chemicals, stress and 
                    the ravages of time. <br>
