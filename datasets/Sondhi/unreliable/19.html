    <p class="text10">Dear Internet Friend,</p>
    <br />
    <p class="text11">Yes, you really can lose weight without dieting!</p>
    <p class="text10">OK, you've probably heard claims like that before. But this time it is different...</p>
<p class="text10">This time the proof exists, and it comes from no other then the U.S. Food And Drug Administration.</p>
<p class="text10">Give me just 2 minutes of your attention and I'll prove it to you right now&hellip;</p>
	<br />
    <p class="text11">Why the FDA doesn't want you to lose weight</p>
    <p class="text10">Recent announcements have stated that 50% of Americans are now overweight and approximately 25% are obese. Yet ironically, overweight and obesity rates in the U.S. <strong>remained virtually unchanged from</strong> 1960 to 1980, only to skyrocket from 1980 - 2000, <strong>the same period "diet" products were introduced.</strong></p><p class="text10">It's just a coincidence, you might think. Well, unfortunately, it is not&hellip;</p><p class="text10"><strong>The US Food and Drug Administration has been involved for years in a string of lawsuits</strong> mostly against weight loss supplement industry,&hellip; but this is old news. What amazes me, however, is the fact that some other lawsuits have been filed&hellip; <strong>against the FDA!</strong></p><p class="text10">One of them has forced the release of piles of government documents clearly showing the correlation between the chemical substances approved by the FDA and put into our food, and the obesity epidemic in America.</p><p class="text10">The disclosed documents have <strong><i>proven beyond a doubt</i></strong> that many types of food and food additives, approved for consumption and repeatedly advertised as being particularly nutritious, <strong>are completely devoid of vital vitamins, minerals and enzymes</strong> needed for optimal digestive health and proper weight&hellip;</p><p class="text10"><strong><i>&hellip;and many are simply poisonous, toxic, or severely allergenic.</i></strong></p>
    <br />
    <p class="text11">These foods make you sick and, in consequence, overweight.</p>
    <p class="text10">But, hold on to your chair, it gets even worse!</p>
    <br />
    <p class="text10"><strong>Further research has revealed that:</strong></p>

    <p class="text14">"Astrid, thank you so much!<br /><br />

I was going through the Secrets ebook slowly and made changes as I went along. You had that 7-day "Detox" diet with the soup that I did on three separate weeks over a two-month period. I learned from that, that I am allergic to wheat. Some of the symptoms I was having include itchy rash-like patches of skin on my face and water retention/inflammation. I thought those were due to perimenopause (I'm 45). But after the detox diet, my complexion was wonderful. When I ate wheat again - even
sprouted wheat - the symptoms returned. So I gave up wheat and I have lost 20 pounds on that and other changes.
I also discontinued use of oils except olive or avocado but only for cold uses, and organic coconut oil or butter for heat use. My diabetic cat would like to thank you for introducing coconut oil to the household.
It's nice to sate him on such a pure fat!
<br /><br />
Your book has been a true blessing to us. Thank you!"

    <p class="text10">And how do I know all that and why should you believe me?</p>
    <p class="text10"><strong>Here are 4 good reasons to believe what I say:</strong></p>
    
    <p class="text10"><strong>One:</strong> I am the living proof that my weight loss system works.</p>

<p class="text10">It took me almost 2 years to conduct a detailed research at the National Library of Medicine, the Library of Congress and on the Internet, and to gather hundreds of pages of epidemiological studies, government documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, reports circulating among medical doctors, and highly scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p class="text10"><strong>But it took me only another 4 months to go from 195 lb to 136 lb using my newly developed weight loss plan.</strong></p>

<p class="text10">Just look at the pictures.</p>

<p class="text10">In addition to feeling lighter and more energetic my eyesight has also improved, my asthma has completely disappeared and severe headaches are gone.</p>

<p class="text10">And I've kept every single pound off for 5 years now!</p>
	<img src="images/Picture-2.jpg" width="164" height="259" alt="picture2" class="image2"/>
    <p class="text10"><strong>Two:</strong> 97% of the information you read about various weight loss programs is either <strong>completely outdated and ineffective or it's simply too complicated and confusing</strong> for the average person to use.</p>

<p class="text10"><strong>Why do you think most of the diet gurus are reluctant to put their own "before" and "after" pictures on their websites?</strong> How do they know that a weight loss formula they've devised work for others, without trying it on themselves?</p>

<p class="text10"><strong>Three:</strong> There are thousands of fad diets. But the fact is that <strong>most diets don't work. If they did, we wouldn't have so many obese people.</strong></p>

<p class="text10">Diets that do work are based on deprivation - counting calories, restricting portion sizes or meticulously following boring menus, which sooner or later leads to lower metabolic rates and undesirable loss of muscle and organ tissue. Eventually hunger wins the day and the weight loss process breaks down, leaving you feeling a failure.</p>

<p class="text10">The word diet usually sparks negative images of sacrifice, starvation and punishment. <strong><i>My plan won't let you feel any of this because it is not a diet.</i></strong></p>

<p class="text10"><strong>Four:</strong> I'm NOT going to promise you can lose 30 pounds in 30 days or shed 10 pounds in a weekend. I don't know you, your weight, height, age, lifestyle, nor your metabolic rate.</p>

<p class="text10">How could I guarantee such a thing?</p>

<p class="text10">But what I can promise you is this:</p>

<p class="text10"><strong>If you follow my advice you will lose weight - guaranteed. And you will do it painlessly, healthily and steadily, without any other effort on your part.</strong></p>

<p class="text10"><strong>This really is the nearest thing to a 'magic weight loss formula' that you are going to find.</strong></p>
	<br />
    <br />
    <p class="text15">Warning: I do NOT, by any means, endorse any get-fit-quick formulas, but due to the enormous amount of email from people begging me to help them to lose weight fast because of a wedding, graduation, summer or any other "special event" coming up very soon, I offer you as free bonuses, and for a limited time only, six different, supposedly extremely powerful weight loss formulas you can immediately put into action. They might make you slimmer faster, but not necessarily healthier. Simply scroll down and read the details.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="text14">"This is the BEST diet book I've ever read. It is like an encyclopedia, how-to manual and nutritional guide - all rolled into one. I'm constantly referring back to it. I don't know how I could have lived without it! I has given me my life back. For the last 10 years I have battled severe depression, fatigue and obesity. Now, after reading your guide something just clicked in my head and suddenly I no longer had to figure out what was wrong with me. I simply knew! Now I feel as if those terrible 10 years and 40 lb have been lifted off my body. I feel like a teenager and I look like a teenager! Thank you Astrid!"<br /><br />

I started to realize years ago that there was something going on with the food in our country. After years and years of research and personal experience I have come to the same conclusions as you have. I couldn't put the book down and would like everyone I know to read it so they see that the things I have been saying for years are valid. Unfortunately most people are 'sheeple' and never question anything. They just keep swilling their cans of diet soda and taking prescription drugs for every little symptom which is brought on by the lousy American diet. I wish I knew even one person who could or would read this and get it like I do...But I don't. Great job!  It should be a New York Times best seller."<br /><br />
