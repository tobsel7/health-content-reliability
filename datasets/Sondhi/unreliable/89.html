The recession is causing many women to completely abandon their beauty regimen. Many people are surfing the net for trial offers to more advanced teeth whitening systems not found in stores. One such mom, Erika Kaplan, discovered a simple trick using 2 different companies offers: <a href="dazzle.php" target="_blank">Dazzle Smile</a> and  <a href="southbeachbrite.php" target="_blank">South Beach Brite</a>. &quot;Most people only use one kind of whitener, get mixed results and then move on,&quot; states Erika. &quot;I got blindingly white teeth by combining 2 different companies that only cost me a few dollars in shipping charges. <strong>It worked</strong> because one product is a whitening pen and another is a whitening tray- <strong>combining the two produces a full super whitening.</strong> &quot; <strong> The kind of results she got would normally cost over $400 in a dentists office.</strong>                                        <p>Erika's story of how she wound up with yellow teeth sounds all too familiar to some:</p>                    <div class="block">                      <blockquote>                        <p>When I was younger, everyone used to compliment me on how great my teeth were and how white they looked. However, the older I got the fewer compliments I got as my teeth began to lose their shine and luster and began to become discolored. It must have been all the coffee and soda I was drinking and all the late nights I would stay awake studying or caring for my son. It got to the point that no one seemed to notice my teeth anymore and the compliments seemed to have stopped. No more “great smile Erika” or “how did you get those pearly whites? What’s your secret?” Even my husband started to notice the discoloration and he doesn’t notice anything. I knew it was bad when my little boy was learning his colors, looked up at me one day, pointed to my teeth and said “yella”. That’s when I knew I needed to find a way to whiten and brighten my teeth again but where to start, that was the question.                      </p>                      </blockquote>                    </div>                    <p>She goes on to explain how she found these products and how they worked:</p>                    <div class="block">                      <blockquote>                        <p>One of my friends from school said she used these great online products before taking family pictures. She recommended a combination of two products South Beach Brite and Dazzle White. I was skeptical and hesitant at first, but then she showed me a picture of how yellow her teeth used to be and I noticed how beautiful they looked now and knowing that I had nothing coming up that I needed to have pearly whites for in case it did not work, I figured what did I have to lose. Even better, she noticed how skeptical I was and told me that the company even let her try the product for free for 14 days in what the company referred to as a trial and that was what hooked her into giving it a try.  I figured what did I have to lose by trying it also and that way, instead of spending the $200 that the dentist was charging for professional teeth whitening, it would only cost me the original shipping if I did not like the product...What I noticed is that both the products worked differently and made unique improvements. Each product addressed my stains differently and created a whiter smile than if I had used only one product. By using them both in a row I was able to get even better results, and because they both had trials I was able to do the whole thing without paying anything but shipping charges. The whole trick to this is to combine the two trial products.</p></blockquote>                    </div>                    <p>Erika: &quot;You wouldn't believe it, but I managed to find a result as good or better than going to a expensive dentist office visit. <strong>These teeth whitening companies are really desperate for business in this economy and  are offering trials to their products.</strong>.&quot;</p>                    <p> But Erika didn't stop there - after finding the special trial offers, Erika used the quick thinking many people are using in this recession, <strong>and obtained special discount codes and links</strong> that reduce the shipping charges on the first trial to <strong> $1.95</strong>--making it possible to get them both shipped for under $4 total.                    </p>                    <p>Most clever, perhaps, is the fact that combining two different  trial products, and using them one after another, allowed Erika to get what could effectively be described as a&quot;super whitening&quot; without breaking the bank. </p>                    <p> When we asked Erika more about her discovery, she explained that &quot;The trick is to use <strong>TWO trial products</strong> that compliment each other <strong>TOGETHER</strong> to give yourself a whitening that's better than you ever could have expected.&quot;<br />                      <br />                    Thank you to Erika for this week's consumer tip. Erika has shared her discovery with thousands of people over the internet.  If you're interested in using Erikas's trick, we've provided links and coupon code information below.  Remember, to get results like Erikas's, you will want to use <strong>BOTH</strong> products together. <strong>The coupon codes reduce shipping costs to under $4 total.....</strong>$1.95 for each product as of October 19, 2009                    <p>                    <p> Step 1: <a href="/dazzle.php" target="_blank">Click here for Dazzle Smile</a> <span class="highlight">(Use Promo Code: <strong>whiteteeth</strong>)</span></p>                    <p>                      Step 2: <a href="/southbeachbrite.php" target="_blank">Click here for South Beach Brite</a> <span class="highlight">(Use Promo Code: <strong>perfect smile</strong>)</span></p>                                                      <p align="right"><span class="style4">                                              </span></p>                    <p>Would you like to share a consumer tip for next week?
