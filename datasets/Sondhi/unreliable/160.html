                      <br>
                    Date: Wednesday, 10:43 a.m.<br>
                    <br>
                    Place: Seattle, Washington<br>

                    <p class="style76"><span class="style77">I</span>'d always dreamed of flying faster than the speed of sound. </p>
                    <p>From the days I used to sit on my grandfather's lap, listening to the stories of his life as pilot, I wanted nothing more then to be like him. </p>
                    <p>He told me stories of flying B-52&rsquo;s across the Atlantic. And how he'd shuttled the <strong>rich and famous</strong> around the world in their Leer jets. From those early days as a young boy I'd paved my path in life to become a United States Navy fighter pilot. </p>
                    <p>I played sports, was involved in student council, and volunteered for extra-curricular activities whenever I could. I went to college, got good grades and stayed in shape. I even got my pilots license. </p>

                    But there was one stubborn, &ldquo;thorn-in-my-side&rdquo; roadblock that stopped me dead in my tracks - <u>perfect</u> <u>eyesight</u>.
                    <p>The Navy required that their pilot candidates have perfect 20/20 vision in order to qualify - and I wasn't even close. By this time in my life I'd been wearing glasses for a long time and my vision was pretty much horrible. </p>
                    <p><strong>Lasik surgery wasn&rsquo;t an option either.</strong> The Navy invests millions of dollars into training their pilots and with the side-effects people are having after getting Lasik surgery like dry, burning eyes, poor night vision, halo&rsquo;s around bright objects and deteriorating vision, they don&rsquo;t want to <u>risk</u> their investment. </p>

                    <p>And frankly, although I would have done just about anything, there&rsquo;s still something about a laser cutting and burning my eyes that I wasn't all that excited about. </p>
                    <p>As you can imagine, I was heartbroken... </p>
                    <h3 align="center">The one  thing I had no control over - <u>bad</u> <u>vision</u> - was the only thing holding me back from achieving my dreams.                    </h3>
                    <p>I ended up hating my glasses even more. Not only were they keeping me from my dreams, they were just a downright <u>pain</u><strong>.</strong> </p>
                    <p>I'm sure you can relate... If you aren't losing them or scratching them, you're dropping them and bending them all out of shape. The headaches they cause and how they can just make your eyes feel downright tired sometimes. </p>
                    <p>And while glasses look good on some people, I wasn&rsquo;t one of them. I&rsquo;m one of those not-so-lucky guys that started losing his hair in his 20&rsquo;s, and the glasses weren&rsquo;t exactly making me look any younger!</p>
                    <p>I tried contacts but they were even worse. They stung, itched, scratched and every morning it&rsquo;s like you have to pop your eyeballs into your head. </p>
                    <p>Even back then glasses and contacts weren&rsquo;t cheap. I was dropping <strong>$200 - $400 a year</strong> on one pair of glasses, and I know those prices have almost <u>doubled</u> <u>or</u> <u>tripled</u> since. That was almost an entire paycheck for me!</p>
                    <h3 align="center">So after months of agony, I reluctantly decided I'd be better off working toward a career as a commercial airline pilot. </h3>
                    <p>The vision requirements aren't as strict to qualify as a commercial airline pilot (you only need 20/20 vision <u>with</u> your glasses on), so I knew I hopefully wouldn't have anymore setbacks. </p>
                    <p>I worked my way up through the ranks, flying little rickety old cargo planes by myself, across the country, in the middle of the night (that&rsquo;s a whole different story in itself). I flew tours of the erupting volcano in Hawaii (crazy huh?). I even taught other aspiring pilots how to fly.</p>
                    <p>I flew as much as I could until I finally logged enough flight time and experience to land my first job as a commercial airline pilot. </p>
                    <p>Man was I excited! Life was good. I had a great job and fell in love with the girl of my dreams. The rough parts of my life were smoothing out and I saw a future that looked pretty darn good.</p>
                    <h3 align="center">And then&hellip; September 11th, 2001.</h3>
                    <p>As I&rsquo;m sure you remember, it was a terrible time for the airlines. Just about every airline in the country was struggling just to stay afloat. And mine was no different.</p>
                    <p>I knew we were in trouble when rumors of &ldquo;cutbacks&rdquo; started bouncing around the company, and it didn&rsquo;t take long for the lay-off notices began. The first wave of pilots were let go. Then the second wave was notified. Finally, the third was notified, and my name was in the hat. </p>
                    <p><strong>I was devastated. </strong></p>
                    <p>I felt sorry for myself, whined, and was seriously considering life as a bartender somewhere in the Caribbean! </p>

                    <p>After a few months of pathetic whining and complaining, I was ready to wipe away the tears and get on with my life. But I still had no idea what I was going to do. That was until the day  I was flying one of my last flights before my final layoff date&hellip; </p>
                    <p>I was flying with an old, grey-haired ex-Navy pilot.  He had probably logged more flight time in an airplane then he had spent with his feet on the ground. He was the type of pilot that gives passengers that warm, fuzzy feeling when they see him in the cockpit.</p>
                    <p>As we were flying along at 25,000 feet I mentioned to him how I&rsquo;d always dreamed of flying fighter jets for the United States Navy but couldn&rsquo;t qualify because of my eyes.</p>
                    <h3 align="center">That was the moment my life changed forever.</h3>
                    <p>He looked right at me and in an old, gruff, matter-of-fact voice he said <strong>&ldquo;well, you ever done eye exercises?&rdquo;</strong> He told me that they'd been around for years and were used by pilots and professional atheletes around the world to improve and sharpen their vision. </p>
                    <p>Now,  I was skeptical to say the least. After all, if eye exercises really worked to improve your vision then why hadn&rsquo;t I heard about them before? And why weren&rsquo;t other people I knew using them to improve their vision?</p>
                    <p>But curiosity got the best of me, so I began to investigate eye exercises and natural vision improvement. After all, I had nothing to lose.</p>
                    <p>And I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I found&hellip; Medical journals containing over 75 years of research attesting to eye exercises and their effectiveness. Scientific studies like these: </p>

                    <p>It all made sense. My eyesight kept getting worse, while the rest of my body was getting stronger and <u>healthier</u> through exercise and healthy living. </p>
                    <p>So after wearing glasses and contacts for a good portion of my life, I began doing these eye exercises for a short time every day. They were really easy, and actually kind of fun to do.</p>

                    After wearing glasses for so many years, I'd officially passed the visual acuity test given to United States Navy fighter pilots!

                    <p>By doing these simple eye exercises, the one stubborn, agonizing, heart-breaking roadblock that had left my dreams of becoming a United States fighter pilot empty and unfulfilled had been overcome. </p>
                    <p><strong>A few weeks later my vision was tested at 20/20</strong> without glasses and  the restriction that the FAA had mandated on my medical certificate that I was &ldquo;required to wear glasses while flying&rdquo; was removed. </p>
                    <p>And after wearing them for a good portion of my life, I didn&rsquo;t need my glasses for anything. Not even for flying an airplane full of passengers across the country!</p>
                    <p>As you can imagine, people couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Friends, family, fellow pilots. Everyone I knew wanted to know why I wasn't wearing my glasses anymore.</p>
                    <h3 align="center" class="style83">Even <span class="style79">Men&rsquo;s Health Magazine&reg;</span> caught word of my story and featured it in their February, 2003 issue! </h3>

                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t think so!</p>

                    <p>After I discovered all of the great research about eye exercises and natural vision improvement and I improved my own vision, I began to wonder the same thing you're probably wondering right now&hellip;</p>

                    <p>Now I&rsquo;m not one to buy into conspiracy theories, but facts are facts. A majority of a <strong>doctors profits comes from selling you the glasses</strong>, contacts, and accessories that you need after every yearly eye exam. Their profits don't come from the eye exam itself. Do you ever wonder why many places offer a free or ridiculouly cheap <u>eye</u> <u>exam</u>? </p>
                    <p>If eye exercises were presented as an option and you didn&rsquo;t need new glasses every year, that&rsquo;s money that you aren&rsquo;t spending &ndash; every year. And, well, you get the point.</p>
                    <p>But there are actually a few doctors that specialize in eye exercises and improving your vision naturally. They are called &ldquo;behavioral optometrists.&rdquo; And while there aren&rsquo;t nearly as many of them, they are a great resource for improving your vision problems. </p>

                    <p> For arguments sake, let&rsquo;s just compare the Rebuild Your Vision Program to the other 2 choices you have when it comes to treating your vision problems:</p>
                    <span class="style5">Choice #1: Glasses &amp; Contacts</span>
                    <p>Glasses and contacts are an <u>ongoing</u> <u>cost</u>. Every year you can easily drop $500 - $800 dollars on a new pair. When you add up the cost over a lifetime, glasses or contacts could easily cost you over $20,000. Ouch!</p>
                    <p>And glasses and contacts only put a band-aid on the problem. They don&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;improve&rdquo; your vision.&rdquo; Not to mention always feeling handcuffed to them. Once you become dependant on them, you need them to do just about anything and everything.</p>
                    <span class="style5">Choice #2: Lasik Surgery</span>
                    <p>Lasik surgery is no cheap endeavor either. The average cost of Lasik surgery ranges from $2,000 - $5,000, and there&rsquo;s still no guarantee that you won&rsquo;t need your glasses or contacts. </p>
                    <p>Many people find that although Lasik works initially, they need their glasses again a few years later. <strong>Not to mention all the nasty side effects that have been reported </strong>after Lasik surgery like dry and scratchy eyes, halo&rsquo;s around bright objects, glare, and difficulty driving at night just to name a few.</p>
                    <p>Even as of this year (April, 2008) the FDA announced it would be &quot;re-investigating&quot; the safety of Lasik surgery due to all of the complaints and problems that have been reported to them. </p>
                    <span class="style5">Choice #3: The Rebuild Your Vision Program</span>
                    <p>The Rebuild Your Vision Program addresses the <u>underlying</u> <u>cause</u> of your vision problems and improves your vision from the inside. </p>
                    <p>There are no ongoing costs or risky side effects. The Rebuild Your Vision Program eye exercises are  safe and work quickly and easily. Best of all, you can get it at just a fraction of the cost of glasses, contacts, or laser surgery. </p>
                    <h3 align="center">Now, in my experience, most people over-promise what their product or service can do for you. So, consider this&hellip; </h3>
                    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you could get the Rebuild Your Vision Program today for  $197, and all it did was just stopped your vision from getting worse for the next two years.</p>
                    <p>Remember, I&rsquo;m drastically <strong><u>understating</u></strong> what the Rebuild Your Vision Program could do.</p>
                    <p>Would it be worth it? </p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s a no-brainer&hellip; Of course it would! </p>
                    <p>You&rsquo;d <u>save</u> two to four times that much in new glasses and contacts in one year alone. And the piece of mind knowing your vision isn&rsquo;t getting worse every year is priceless.</p>
                    <p>But as you can see from the stories on this website the Rebuild Your Vision Program over delivers on what people expect. Their vision improves more then they&rsquo;d ever dreamed possible and they're freed from needing glasses or contacts.</p>
                    <p>So even though the Rebuild Your Vision Program would be a great investment at $197, for a limited time, I'm making you a very special offer I'm positive you can't refuse, because...</p>

                    <p align="left">Certainly, you must be wondering why - with so much proven success behind the Rebuild Your Vision Program - I would be giving it away for free. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="style72">Here's why I'm doing it:</p>
                    <p align="left">Because I know that once you get the Rebuild Your Vision Program and start doing the eye exercises, you won't WANT to give it back.</p>
                    <p align="left"> You'll be able to read, write, and watch TV without your glasses or contacts, and you'll be so excited about how much your vision improves and how much stronger your eyes feel, you simply won't want to part with it.</p>
                    <p align="left">So after 30 days, you'll be happy to hand over $97 to keep the program.</p>
                    <p>That's less then half-the-price of a pair of glasses or contacts, and about one-tenth the cost of Lasik surgery.</p>
                    <p>But more then that, you'll actually be <strong>improving</strong> your vision safely and naturally. You won&rsquo;t be masking your vision problems and you won&rsquo;t be going under the knife. You can enjoy a life with clear and healthy vision.</p>
                    <p>But WAIT! I want to make it even EASIER
                      for you...</p>

This time I needed to wear glasses with my helmet and found it very restrictive and cumbersome. I decided to look for alternatives to wearing eyeglasses. </p>
                    <p>Three months ago I came across Orlin's website and bought a 'Rebuild Your Vision' kit.
                      After three weeks of exercises my vision had improved from around 20/70 to 20/40. 
                      For the next four or five weeks my vision did not improve, in fact, it seemed to go
                      backwards a little. I emailed the support center and received guidance from Tyler. I was neglecting
                      the relaxation exercises and began doing them properly. I also found that six to seven days of exercise per week was too much for me. I trimmed back to doing the full round of exercises for three days per week and doing mild rotational and relaxing exercises every other day. </p>
                    <p>Another important factor was using the 10-10-10 rule at work. I use a computer all day and needed to refocus my eyes regularly.
                      After another four weeks of exercising my vision is now officially at 20/30, bordering on 20/25.
                      By Christmas I will have 20/20 vision at my current rate of improvement.&quot;</p>

I try to do the exercises daily and have noticed a big improvement. I wore contacts for 35 years but gradually depended more and more on my glasses in addition to the contacts for driving and watching t.v. I was becoming upset because my near vision was impaired by wearing contacts and yet my distant vision was not very good either. In addition, I am developing cataracts and my night vision was becoming so poor, I dreaded driving at night - especially in the rain. I ditched my contacts as soon as I started your course and used my glasses for distance only. I also started to take Lutein supplements. </p>
                    <p>At first I didn't see very well, but my near vision was much better than before as my contacts were such that my near vision was distorted in order to see distance. I adjusted very quickly to not wearing contacts. I was able to wear my prescription glasses for driving at night and now could see clearly with them even in the rain. In January, I was traveling and unable to do the exercises so depended on my glasses for distance but when I came back in February and resumed the exercises, my vision has continued to improve. I now only wear my enhancement distance glasses for driving and watching t.v. (really only for the small print on the set) I feel so much freedom as I no longer have to deal with contacts and am only using my glasses sparingly. My eyes feel and look healthier. I didn't know it was possible to improve your vision with exercise until I stumbled upon the &quot;Rebuild Your Vision&quot; website and took a chance by ordering the kit. It certainly has been money well spent. Thank you so much!&quot; </p>

I decided to try to fulfill my childhood dream of flying fighter jets for the United States Navy but there was one thing that had always held me back&nbsp;- perfect eyesight.&nbsp;I was forced to find an alternative to glasses and corrective surgery as the Navy demands near perfect, uncorrected vision from their pilots. I admit I was skeptical when I first learned about vision training, but after reading documented results from the American Optometric Association and over&nbsp;75 years of research attesting to the effectiveness of vision training, I started to believe. I thought about how my eyesight kept getting worse, while the rest of my body was getting stronger and healthier through normal exercise and healthy living. </p>
                    <p>Through the Rebuild Your Vision program I improved my vision from 20/85 to 20/25 in 30 days passing the visual acuity test given to United States Navy fighter pilots, and threw away&nbsp;my glasses after using them for nearly 10 years. A few months later, the restriction that I was required to wear glasses while flying was removed from my FAA medical certificate. The one thing I had always been told I had no control over has been overcome.&quot; </p>

I read about lasik and even visited a lasik doctor. That was tempting to me to get lasik. But, I wanted something more natural. So, I found out about Rebuild Your Vision, and the rest is history.

Well I need to tell you that I am very impressed with the excercises and I do recommend that people who really want to better there eye sight and do the exercises religiously will see improvement. </p>
                    <p>You see I had just been told by the license Bureau that they would not be renewing my Class 1A drivers license which is for driving a tractor trailer which is my livelyhood as my eye sight was 20/40 and it had to be at least 20/30 to keep my license or I would be only allowed a class 5 to drive a car. I would not be allowed to drive any commercial vehicle until I was able to show 20/30 vision. I ordered your excercise program for the eyes and I did the exercises very religiously and spent 25 minutes twice a day on them and I was tested at 20/20 vision and was allowed to keep my license. I would not send this letter if I was not able to prove that what I am saying is true. </p>

I was really dismayed to realize my sight had deteriorated so much since I had had LASIK about 9 years ago at a cost of $5000.00. I simply didn't want an &quot;enhancement&quot; and had resolved myself to the prospect of wearing bifocals. I couldn't see anything up close or the street signs anymore as I was driving. I thought I had no choice but to get glasses. When I tried to see an optometrist as a walk in, he was on vacation. So I decided to try to find out more about my vision problems and consulted the internet. That's when I came across your program. I had never heard of vision therapy before! This has made a real difference in my life. Thanks! My vision is already close to 20/20 again. It is so nice to have control over keeping my vision sharp.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I just wanted to let you know that I have been using Rebuild Your Vision for just over a year now and haven't had to wear glasses at all since the day I started the program. Last year, after I finished my first semester of graduate school, I noticed that my vision was getting progressively worse. All those hours hitting the books and typing papers had taken their toll. A friend had Lasik done and was very happy with the results, but I knew even if I liked the results, my wallet wouldn't! It was just too expensive. Plus I had eye surgery as a teenager (for lazy eye) and really wasn't anxious to be poked and prodded like that again. I thought, 'There has to be something I can do to help my eyes without paying through the nose with the very real possibility that I might have to wear glasses again later in life anyway.' The whole thing just seemed counter productive. That's when I hit the internet and typed in 'noninvasive eye improvement' and up came Rebuild Your Vision. It sounded perfect...in fact almost too good to be true. But, I figured that at $84 if this thing was for real, it was worth a shot, and even if it wasn't, I could still afford graduate school. (Translation: I didn't have to turn over nearly $5000 for it.)</p>
                    <p>The exercises fit in perfectly with my schedule. They were also easily adaptable for me. I simply sat to do all of them, instead of standing for some, and lowered the charts to accommodate. I couldn't be happier with the results. There was marked improvement within as little as 5 days and continued improvement since then. My eyesight has gone from 20/120 (R) and 20/240 (L) to 20/40 in both eyes and continues to improve daily. I love the fact that after 28 years of wearing glasses, I finally feel like my eyes belong to me, instead of being held hostage behind a pair of lenses. Even better, I know they always will. Thanks so much!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I ordered the program earlier this year, but due to my heavy workload, I had not used it until recently. My initial right and left eye prescription before beginning the program was -7.5 and -6.5 respectively and I had been using glasses for over 20 years. After about 2 months of using your program I am now maintaining a right and left eye prescription of -4.5 and -3.5, almost half of my previous prescription and hoping to achieve a perfect vision!&quot; </p>

                    <p>&quot;Although I had been looking for ways to improve my eyesight, it was not until a few weeks ago when I finally decided to order Rebuild Your Vision. Half-heartedly, I started to practice the 1st set of exercises and then, noticed that I started to see clearly sometimes right after blinking, which went back to fuzzy just as son I blinked again. I started to follow exercises again more regularly and started to see difference each day after that.</p>
                    <p>I was wearing progressives, and the first thing that I was able to notice was that I started to see everything clearly near to me and I started to read without any problems. Now, although a bit fuzzy (distant scenes only), I am even watching television etc. without glasses. Thank you!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I started the Rebuild Your Vision system in December after I got out of school for the winter break. After the completion of the thirty days I noticed that I could see the black board much clearer and much farther away. I usually would have to use my glasses whenever I was forced to sit in the back. Now I can sit anywhere in the classroom and can see the board without my glasses much better than before. I plan to start the program again soon to see how much more improvement I can achieve. Thank You!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I am truly amazed! Last week I went to the eye specialist who told me I was going to need stronger glasses again this year and likely the same was going to be true next year as well. Last week I had to use my reading glasses and move the monitor closer to see it clearly. I couldn't read text close at hand at all. I began the exercises on Sunday morning. Monday I started to use the computer screen without my glasses. I adjusted the position slightly to help in adapting. Yesterday I was able to see the computer screen clearly but wasn't able to read any text that was closer than about 26 inches from my eyes. This morning (Wednesday) I looked at the paperwork and just about fell over, I could read it! I have literally put my glasses away!!! Am I satisfied? FOR SURE! I'm already starting to pass the word around! A sincere thanks.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;This program is unbelievable! I'm 48 and have noticed my eyesight getting worse and worse. The first thing I noticed was not being able to look a number up in the phonebook, then the newspaper was not readable without glasses...on and on, I had to stop to get a pair of glasses for simple things. I had a pair in every room! I ordered Rebuild Your Vision, and after doing the exercises for 7 days, I was already noticing a difference, so I grabbed the phonebook to look up a number, and I found the number without my glasses!!! Thank you!&quot; </p>

                    <p>&quot;I have been a diagnosed myopic since I was 10 years old! Just last year, after 20 years, my prescription was -5.25 left, -5.00 right. While this is not earth shattering bad, it was bad enough.&nbsp;I needed to wear my glasses constantly. And I got very tired of it.&nbsp;I looked into LASIK, but I don't like the idea of surgery on my eyes and I like the unknown future results even less. So, I got on the internet, found your site and product and tried it last August.</p>
                    <p>And it has been amazing!&nbsp;Last Tuesday, I had my yearly eye exam and my prescription in now -4.25 left, -4.00 right!!&nbsp;An amazing improvement! I will continue using this product forever!!!!!!! NO more crutches! Thank you!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;One year ago I had Laser surgery to correct distance in my right eye and a very bad astigmatism (born with) in my left eye. While this was successful I was still not happy as the distance in my left eye was not great. I came across your Program and commenced it on 1-01-06. Then my vision was at 10ft left 20/120, right 20/80. I have exercised every day since and my vision on 1-09-06 was, left 20/60, right 20/40. Now at 20 ft it was left 20/40, right 20/20.</p>
                    <p>Quite a difference in 8 months I am delighted and intend to continue on a daily basis. Thank you so much for your help. Oh as a matter of interest I am 65 years of age.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I purchased Rebuild your Vision about a year ago. The reason was that I wanted to become a sailplane instructor (I was already&nbsp;a qualified sailplane pilot), At that time my vision was 6 over 6 in my left eye and &quot;not measurable&quot; in my right, lazy eye. Using the principles explained in Rebuild Your Vision, combined with some additional exercises (computer driven) that I found, I improved my vision to 6 over 5 in my left eye and 6 over 18 uncorrected, 6 over 12 corrected, in my right eye. I am now a qualified sailplane instructor. It is my firm belief that it is the Rebuild your Vision&nbsp;philosophy that worked for me, I had tried other stuff over many years without success.&quot;</p>
